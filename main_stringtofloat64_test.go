FUNCTION_DEF=func stringToFloat64(str string) float64 
Scenario 1: Valid String Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts a valid string representation of a floating-point number to a float64.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid floating-point number.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 2: String with Leading and Trailing Whitespace

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings with leading and trailing whitespace by trimming them before conversion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid floating-point number with leading and trailing whitespace.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 3: Empty String

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles an empty string input gracefully by exiting the program with a specific error code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string variable.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the program exits with error code 2.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 4: Invalid String

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles an invalid string input gracefully by exiting the program with a specific error code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing an invalid floating-point number representation.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the program exits with error code 2.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 5: String with Scientific Notation

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts a string in scientific notation to a float64.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid floating-point number in scientific notation.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 6: String with Different Locales

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles strings with different locale-specific decimal separators correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid floating-point number with a locale-specific decimal separator.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 7: String with Special Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles strings with special characters gracefully by exiting the program with a specific error code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing special characters.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the program exits with error code 2.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 8: String with Very Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a very large floating-point number.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 9: String with Very Small Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles very small numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a very small floating-point number.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value matches the expected value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 10: String with Mixed Case

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings with mixed case letters, which should be invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a mixed case floating-point number representation.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the program exits with error code 2.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
