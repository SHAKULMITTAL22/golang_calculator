Scenario 1: Valid Float String Conversion Test

Details:
    Description: This test is to verify the basic functionality of stringToFloat64 method by passing a string which can be converted into a float number successfully.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid string that can be converted to a float64, such as "123.45".
    Act: Invoke stringToFloat64() with the provided string.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the returned float64 matches the expected float value.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the function correctly parses valid float strings and returns the correct float64. This is significant for the overall functionality of the calculator as incorrect conversions could lead to incorrect calculations.

Scenario 2: Invalid Float String Conversion Test

Details:
    Description: This test is to verify the behavior of stringToFloat64 when an invalid string is passed that cannot be converted into a float number.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an invalid string that cannot be converted to a float64, like "abc".
    Act: Invoke stringToFloat64() with the mentioned invalid string.
    Assert: Expect an os.Exit(2) to be executed.
Validation:
    The test ensures that the function properly handles invalid inputs and exits the program with the correct code(2). Even though we generally avoid causing the program to exit in the case of an error, there are scenarios where it's better to stop the execution to prevent further incorrect data manipulation.

Scenario 3: Boundary Case Test

Details:
Description: This test is to check the behavior of the function when a float string with maximum precision is passed which is in the allowable range for float64.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a string representation of a float64 at its highest precision.
    Act: Invoke stringToFloat64() with the mentioned string.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the returned float64 matches the expected float value.
Validation:
    The assertion validates that the function correctly parses float strings at the highest precision. This test is critical in some situations where maximum precision float numbers are being manipulated.

Scenario 4: Empty Float String Conversion Test

Details:
    Description: This test is to verify the behavior of stringToFloat64 when an empty string is passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty string.
    Act: Invoke stringToFloat64() with the mentioned empty string.
    Assert: Expect an os.Exit(2) to be executed.
Validation:
    The test ensures that the function handles empty strings and exits the program with the correct code(2). As an empty string cannot be converted to float, this scenario maintains robust behavior of our function.
