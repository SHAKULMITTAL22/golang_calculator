FUNCTION_DEF=func stringToFloat64(str string) float64
Scenario 1: Valid String Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts a valid string representation of a float64 number to a float64 type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid float64 number.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected float64 number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for a valid input. This test ensures that the function correctly parses and returns the float64 value.

Scenario 2: String with Leading and Trailing Whitespace

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings with leading and trailing whitespace by trimming them before conversion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid float64 number with leading and trailing whitespace.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected float64 number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for a valid input with whitespace. This test ensures that the function correctly trims and parses the float64 value.

Scenario 3: String with Positive Sign

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that include a positive sign.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid float64 number with a positive sign.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected float64 number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for a valid input with a positive sign. This test ensures that the function correctly parses the float64 value.

Scenario 4: String with Negative Sign

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that include a negative sign.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid float64 number with a negative sign.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected float64 number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for a valid input with a negative sign. This test ensures that the function correctly parses the float64 value.

Scenario 5: String with Scientific Notation

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that represent float64 numbers in scientific notation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid float64 number in scientific notation.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected float64 number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for a valid input in scientific notation. This test ensures that the function correctly parses the float64 value.

Scenario 6: Empty String

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles an empty string input by returning an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string variable.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the function prints an error message and exits with status code 2.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for an invalid input. This test ensures that the function correctly handles empty string inputs.

Scenario 7: String with Invalid Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that contain invalid characters by returning an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing invalid characters.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the function prints an error message and exits with status code 2.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for an invalid input. This test ensures that the function correctly handles strings with invalid characters.

Scenario 8: String with Mixed Valid and Invalid Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that contain a mix of valid and invalid characters by returning an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a mix of valid and invalid characters.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the function prints an error message and exits with status code 2.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for an invalid input. This test ensures that the function correctly handles strings with mixed valid and invalid characters.

Scenario 9: String with Very Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that represent very large float64 numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a very large float64 number.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected float64 number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for a valid input representing a very large number. This test ensures that the function correctly parses the float64 value.

Scenario 10: String with Very Small Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that represent very small float64 numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a very small float64 number.
  Act: Call the stringToFloat64 function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected float64 number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function for a valid input representing a very small number. This test ensures that the function correctly parses the float64 value.
