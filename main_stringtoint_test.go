FUNCTION_DEF=func stringToInt(str string) int
 1: Valid Integer Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts a valid string representation of an integer to its corresponding integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that represents a valid integer.
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer matches the expected value.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as we are comparing the output of the function with a known correct value. This test is important to ensure that the basic functionality of converting a valid string to an integer works as expected.

Scenario 2: Valid Negative Integer Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles and converts a string representing a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that represents a negative integer.
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer matches the expected negative value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function can handle negative numbers correctly. This is crucial for applications that deal with negative values, ensuring that the function's behavior is consistent across different ranges of integers.

Scenario 3: Zero Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts the string "0" to the integer 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the string "0".
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the string "0".
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer is 0.
Validation:
  The simplicity of this test ensures that the function handles the zero case appropriately. It is important to verify that the function does not introduce errors when dealing with the simplest non-negative integer.

Scenario 4: Large Positive Integer Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles and converts a string representing a large positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that represents a large positive integer.
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer matches the expected large value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can manage large integers without overflow or other numerical issues. It is crucial for applications dealing with large datasets or calculations.

Scenario 5: Invalid String Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles a string that cannot be converted to an integer, ensuring it exits with the appropriate error code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that is not a valid integer representation (e.g., "abc").
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the function prints an error message and exits with code 2.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function properly identifies invalid inputs and handles them gracefully by exiting the program. This error handling is essential for preventing runtime errors and ensuring robust application behavior.

Scenario 6: String with Leading Spaces

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a string with leading spaces by trimming them before conversion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string with leading spaces (e.g., "  123").
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer matches the expected value after trimming the spaces.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function can handle strings with leading spaces, which is important for user inputs that may include accidental extra spaces.

Scenario 7: String with Trailing Spaces

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a string with trailing spaces by trimming them before conversion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string with trailing spaces (e.g., "123  ").
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer matches the expected value after trimming the spaces.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function can manage strings with trailing spaces, which is crucial for applications that process user inputs with potential extra spaces.

Scenario 8: String with Leading and Trailing Spaces

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a string with both leading and trailing spaces by trimming them before conversion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string with both leading and trailing spaces (e.g., "  123  ").
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer matches the expected value after trimming the spaces.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function can handle strings with both leading and trailing spaces, which is important for robust input processing in various applications.

Scenario 9: Empty String

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles an empty string input, ensuring it exits with the appropriate error code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string.
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the function prints an error message and exits with code 2.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function properly identifies and handles empty string inputs, preventing runtime errors and ensuring robust application behavior.

Scenario 10: String with Non-Digit Characters

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies and handles strings containing non-digit characters, ensuring it exits with the appropriate error code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string with non-digit characters (e.g., "123abc").
  Act: Call the stringToInt function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Verify that the function prints an error message and exits with code 2.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function can handle strings with non-digit characters, which is important for preventing runtime errors and ensuring robust input validation in various applications.
