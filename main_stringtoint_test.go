FUNCTION_DEF=func stringToInt(str string) int
Okay, here are the test scenarios for the `stringToInt` function, following the specified format and considering the Go context.

```
Scenario 1: Valid Positive Integer String Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly converts a string containing a standard positive integer into its corresponding integer representation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str = "123"`.
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned integer value is equal to `123`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: We expect `strconv.Atoi` to successfully parse "123" into the integer 123. The assertion `result == 123` directly validates this successful conversion.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This is a fundamental success case, ensuring the primary purpose of the function (valid string-to-int conversion) works as expected for common positive inputs.

Scenario 2: Valid Negative Integer String Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly converts a string containing a standard negative integer (with a leading minus sign) into its corresponding integer representation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str = "-45"`.
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned integer value is equal to `-45`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `strconv.Atoi` handles negative signs correctly. We expect "-45" to be parsed as the integer -45. The assertion `result == -45` confirms this.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function handles valid negative number representations, which are common inputs in calculations or data processing.

Scenario 3: Valid Zero Integer String Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly converts the string "0" into the integer 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str = "0"`.
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned integer value is equal to `0`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: "0" is a valid integer representation. The assertion `result == 0` confirms that the function handles this specific boundary case correctly.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Zero is often a special case in logic and calculations, so ensuring its correct conversion is important for accuracy.

Scenario 4: Invalid Non-Numeric String Input

Details:
  Description: This test scenario describes the behavior when the input string contains non-numeric characters (e.g., "abc"). It aims to verify the error handling path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str = "abc"`.
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Observe that the program prints an error message (from `strconv.Atoi`) to standard output and then terminates with exit code 2 due to `os.Exit(2)`. *Note: Direct assertion of return value is not possible in a standard Go test because the test process itself will be terminated.*
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `strconv.Atoi("abc")` will return an error because "abc" cannot be parsed as an integer. The function's logic dictates that this error is printed and the program exits. The "assertion" here is observing this specific exit behavior.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This scenario tests the function's robustness against invalid input. While exiting the program is often undesirable in library functions (returning an error is preferred), this test verifies the *implemented* behavior for invalid data, preventing potential crashes later if the error wasn't handled at all.

Scenario 5: Invalid Empty String Input

Details:
  Description: This test scenario describes the behavior when the input string is empty (""). It aims to verify the error handling path for this specific edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str = ""`.
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Observe that the program prints an error message (from `strconv.Atoi`) to standard output and then terminates with exit code 2 due to `os.Exit(2)`. *Note: Direct assertion is not possible due to `os.Exit`.*
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `strconv.Atoi("")` returns an error. The function should detect this error, print it, and exit. Observing the exit code and error message confirms this path.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Empty strings are a common edge case for string processing functions. This test ensures the function handles this specific invalid input according to its defined error logic.

Scenario 6: Invalid String with Leading/Trailing Spaces

Details:
  Description: This test scenario describes the behavior when the input string contains numbers but also leading or trailing whitespace (e.g., " 123" or "123 "). `strconv.Atoi` does not automatically trim spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str = " 456"` (or `"456 "`).
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Observe that the program prints an error message (from `strconv.Atoi`) to standard output and then terminates with exit code 2 due to `os.Exit(2)`. *Note: Direct assertion is not possible due to `os.Exit`.*
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `strconv.Atoi` requires the *entire* string to be a valid integer representation. Strings with leading/trailing spaces will cause `Atoi` to return an error. The function's error handling should then trigger the print and exit.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: User input or data from external sources might contain extraneous whitespace. This test verifies how the function behaves with such potentially malformed (yet common) inputs.

Scenario 7: Invalid Floating-Point String Input

Details:
  Description: This test scenario describes the behavior when the input string represents a floating-point number (e.g., "1.23"). `strconv.Atoi` is specifically for integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str = "1.23"`.
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Observe that the program prints an error message (from `strconv.Atoi`) to standard output and then terminates with exit code 2 due to `os.Exit(2)`. *Note: Direct assertion is not possible due to `os.Exit`.*
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: "1.23" is not a valid syntax for `strconv.Atoi`, which expects only digits and an optional leading sign. An error will be returned by `Atoi`, leading to the print and exit behavior in the function.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function correctly rejects non-integer numeric formats, enforcing the expectation that the input must represent a whole number.

Scenario 8: String Representing Number Outside Integer Range (Overflow/Underflow)

Details:
  Description: This test scenario describes the behavior when the input string represents a number larger than the maximum `int` value or smaller than the minimum `int` value on the target architecture.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an input string `str` representing a very large number (e.g., "99999999999999999999999") or a very small negative number (e.g., "-99999999999999999999999"). The exact value depends on `strconv.IntSize`.
  Act: Call `stringToInt(str)`.
  Assert: Observe that the program prints an error message (from `strconv.Atoi`, typically indicating "value out of range") to standard output and then terminates with exit code 2 due to `os.Exit(2)`. *Note: Direct assertion is not possible due to `os.Exit`.*
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `strconv.Atoi` detects when a syntactically valid number string represents a value that cannot fit into the `int` type and returns a specific range error. The function's error handling should catch this, print the error, and exit.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Protects against potential integer overflow/underflow issues if the input source could provide numbers exceeding the system's integer limits. Verifies that the function handles this specific type of conversion error.
