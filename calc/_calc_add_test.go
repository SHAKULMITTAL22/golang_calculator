FUNCTION_DEF=func Add(num1, num2 int) int // Add two integers

Sure, here are several test scenarios for the `Add` function in the `calc` package, covering normal operation, edge cases, and potential error handling:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Addition

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Add function by adding two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the sum of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as it directly verifies the function's primary purpose. This test is important to ensure that the basic addition operation works correctly.

Scenario 2: Addition with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Add function correctly handles negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the sum of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  Assertion checks the correctness of the function with negative numbers, which is crucial for completeness. This test is important for comprehensive arithmetic validation.

Scenario 3: Addition with Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Add function when one of the integers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one positive integer and one zero integer, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the non-zero integer.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the function handles zero correctly. This test is important to ensure the function does not fail with trivial cases involving zero.

Scenario 4: Addition with Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Add function can handle large integers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two large integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the sum of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can manage large numbers properly. Assertion is based on the mathematical correctness of the sum.

Scenario 5: Addition with Max Int Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Add function when one of the integers is the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one integer as the maximum integer value and another as a small positive integer, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the sum of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not overflow when adding the maximum integer value. Assertion is based on the expectation of correct sum without overflow.

Scenario 6: Addition with Min Int Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Add function when one of the integers is the minimum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one integer as the minimum integer value and another as a small negative integer, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the sum of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the minimum integer value correctly. Assertion is based on the expectation of correct sum without underflow.

Scenario 7: Addition with One Number as Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Add function when one of the integers is zero and the other is a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one integer as zero and another as a positive integer, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the non-zero integer.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where one of the numbers is zero. Assertion is based on the expectation of correct sum with zero.

Scenario 8: Addition with Both Numbers as Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Add function when both integers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define both integers as zero, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Add function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where both numbers are zero. Assertion is based on the expectation of correct sum with both zeros.
```

These scenarios cover a range of inputs, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential boundary conditions, ensuring comprehensive testing of the `Add` function.
