```
Scenario 1: Validate division with positive non-zero numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the Divide function's ability to correctly compute the division of two positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 2`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is `5.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since `10 / 2 = 5`, the function should return `5.0`. This is a basic test to verify normal functionality.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Division with positive values is a core operation and must be verified as correct.

---

Scenario 2: Validate division with a negative numerator

Details:
  Description: This test checks the Divide function's ability to correctly compute the division of a negative numerator with a positive denominator.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = -10` and `num2 = 2`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is `-5.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since `-10 / 2 = -5`, the function should return `-5.0`. This tests behavior with negative numbers.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Handling negative numbers correctly demonstrates proper handling of mathematical operations.

---

Scenario 3: Validate division with a negative denominator

Details:
  Description: This test checks the Divide function's handling of a negative denominator and positive numerator.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 10` and `num2 = -2`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is `-5.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since `10 / -2 = -5`, the function should return `-5.0`. This ensures consistency in dealing with negative inputs.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Correct handling of signed numbers is crucial in many mathematical applications.

---

Scenario 4: Division with zero numerator

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that dividing zero by any non-zero number yields zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 0` and `num2 = 5`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is `0.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Dividing `0 / 5` should return `0`. This is a standard mathematical property.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test confirms the function's proper handling of zero numerators.

---

Scenario 5: Division by zero causes a panic

Details:
  Description: This test validates that the Divide function panics when a zero denominator is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 10` and `num2 = 0`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)` and capture panic.
    Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "division by zero is not allowed".
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Dividing by zero is undefined, so the function correctly panics. The panic message must match the expected text.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Proper handling of division by zero is essential for the application's robustness and adherence to mathematical rules.

---

Scenario 6: Validate division with floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the Divide functionâ€™s ability to handle division with floating-point numbers where precision is essential.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 5.5` and `num2 = 2.0`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is approximately `2.75`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Dividing `5.5 / 2.0` should yield `2.75`. Precision is tested to ensure floating-point math is handled accurately.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Proper behavior with non-integer numbers is often required in calculations like financial or scientific applications.

---

Scenario 7: Validate division with a very large numerator

Details:
  Description: This test ensures the function handles extremely large values without overflow or errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 1e10` and `num2 = 2`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is `5e9`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Dividing `1e10 / 2` should yield `5e9`. This tests handling of large numbers.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Many real-world applications involve large values, making this an essential test.

---

Scenario 8: Validate division with very small numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's handling of very small floating-point inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 1e-10` and `num2 = 2`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is `5e-11`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Dividing `1e-10 / 2` should yield `5e-11`. This ensures precision in small-scale calculations.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Applications requiring scientific computation often deal with small values, making precision critical.

---

Scenario 9: Validate division where numerator equals denominator

Details:
  Description: This test checks that dividing any number by itself correctly yields `1`.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = 8` and `num2 = 8`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the returned value is `1.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `8 / 8 = 1`. This tests correctness for cases where divisor equals dividend.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This scenario represents frequently encountered equality-based division.

---

Scenario 10: Validate division resulting in infinity

Details:
  Description: Tests whether the function handles division resulting in infinity properly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define `num1 = math.MaxFloat64` and `num2 = 1e-308`.
    Act: Call `Divide(num1, num2)`.
    Assert: Verify that the operation doesn't overflow and outputs a finite value.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: While the division should yield a numerically large result, it mustn't overflow to infinity unless explicitly implemented.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensuring finite non-infinite results avoids issues in downstream calculations or data handling.
