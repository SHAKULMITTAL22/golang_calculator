  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 8: Division of Identical Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Divide function correctly handles the division of two identical floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two identical floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the Divide function with the prepared numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is one.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 9: Division with Precision
