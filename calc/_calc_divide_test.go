FUNCTION_DEF=func Divide(num1, num2 float64) float64 // Divide two floating-point numbers (with error handling)

Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `Divide` function in the `calc` package, covering normal operation, edge cases, and error handling:

```
Scenario 1: Divide two positive numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Divide function by dividing two positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare two positive floating-point numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of num1 by num2.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly performs division for positive numbers. This is crucial for ensuring basic arithmetic operations work as expected.

```

```
Scenario 2: Divide positive number by one

Details:
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the second number is 1, which should result in the first number being returned unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare a floating-point number, num1, and set num2 to 1.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to num1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that dividing by 1 does not alter the result, which is a fundamental property of division.

```

```
Scenario 3: Divide zero by a positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the first number is 0, and the second number is positive, which should result in 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 0 and num2 to a positive floating-point number.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test verifies that dividing zero by any positive number correctly returns zero, which is a key property of division.

```

```
Scenario 4: Divide a positive number by zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the error handling when the second number is 0, which should cause a panic with a specific message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare a floating-point number, num1, and set num2 to 0.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that a panic occurs with the message "division by zero is not allowed".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles division by zero by panicking with an appropriate message. This is essential for preventing runtime errors.

```

```
Scenario 5: Divide negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the scenario where both numbers are negative, ensuring the function correctly handles negative division.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare two negative floating-point numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of num1 by num2.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly performs division for negative numbers, which is important for comprehensive arithmetic testing.

```

```
Scenario 6: Divide a positive number by a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the first number is positive and the second number is negative, ensuring the function correctly handles this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare a positive floating-point number, num1, and a negative floating-point number, num2.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of num1 by num2.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles division of a positive number by a negative number, which is a common arithmetic scenario.

```

```
Scenario 7: Divide a negative number by a positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the first number is negative and the second number is positive, ensuring the function correctly handles this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare a negative floating-point number, num1, and a positive floating-point number, num2.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of num1 by num2.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles division of a negative number by a positive number, which is another common arithmetic scenario.

```

```
Scenario 8: Divide two identical negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the scenario where both numbers are identical negative numbers, ensuring the function correctly handles this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare two identical negative floating-point numbers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Divide(num1, num2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  This test verifies that dividing two identical negative numbers results in 1, which is a specific mathematical property.
