FUNCTION_DEF=func Factorial(n int) int // Factorial (Recursive)

Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `Factorial` function in the `calc` package, ensuring coverage for normal operation, edge cases, and error handling:

### Scenario 1: Basic Factorial Calculation

  ```
  Scenario 1: Basic Factorial Calculation

  Details:
    Description: This test checks the normal operation of the Factorial function by calculating the factorial of a positive integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the test by defining a positive integer, e.g., 5.
    Act: Invoke the Factorial function with the test integer.
    Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the expected factorial value (e.g., 120 for 5).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  ```

### Scenario 2: Factorial of Zero

  ```
  Scenario 2: Factorial of Zero

  Details:
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when the input is 0.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the test by defining the integer 0.
    Act: Invoke the Factorial function with the integer 0.
    Assert: Verify that the result is 1, as the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  ```

### Scenario 3: Factorial of One

  ```
  Scenario 3: Factorial of One

  Details:
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when the input is 1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the test by defining the integer 1.
    Act: Invoke the Factorial function with the integer 1.
    Assert: Verify that the result is 1, as the factorial of 1 is defined to be 1.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  ```

### Scenario 4: Factorial of Large Number
  ```
  Scenario 4: Factorial of Large Number

  Details:
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when the input is a large positive integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the test by defining a large integer, e.g., 20.
    Act: Invoke the Factorial function with the large integer.
    Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the expected factorial value (e.g., 2432902008176640000 for 20).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  ```

### Scenario 5: Factorial of Negative Number

  ```
  Scenario 5: Factorial of Negative Number

  Details:
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when the input is a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the test by defining a negative integer, e.g., -5.
    Act: Invoke the Factorial function with the negative integer.
    Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "factorial is not defined for negative numbers".
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  ```

### Scenario 6: Factorial of Maximum Integer

  ```
  Scenario 6: Factorial of Maximum Integer

  Details:
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when the input is the maximum value for an integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the test by defining the maximum value for an integer (math.MaxInt).
    Act: Invoke the Factorial function with the maximum integer value.
    Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "factorial is not defined for negative numbers" when the result overflows.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  ```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `Factorial` function, ensuring that it behaves correctly under normal conditions, edge cases, and error handling scenarios.
