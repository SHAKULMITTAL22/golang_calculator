FUNCTION_DEF=func Factorial(n int) int // Factorial (Recursive)

Scenario 1: Factorial of 0

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function returns 1 for the input 0, which is the base case for the factorial function.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 0.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward since the factorial of 0 is a well-known mathematical property. This test is important to ensure that the base case is handled correctly.

Scenario 2: Factorial of 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function returns 1 for the input 1, another base case for the factorial function.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 1.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the factorial of 1 is also a known mathematical fact. This test ensures that the function handles another base case correctly.

Scenario 3: Factorial of a positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial function with a typical positive integer input to ensure it computes the factorial correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 5 (for example).
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 120 (since 5! = 120).
Validation:
  This test covers the normal operation of the function. It verifies that the recursive calculation is performed correctly for a typical input.

Scenario 4: Factorial of a large positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial function with a large positive integer to ensure it handles large inputs correctly without overflow or performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 20 (for example).
  Assert: Verify that the return value is the correct factorial of 20.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large inputs efficiently. It verifies that the recursive approach does not lead to stack overflow or excessive computation time.

Scenario 5: Negative input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function panics when given a negative input, as factorials are not defined for negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter -1.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "factorial is not defined for negative numbers".
Validation:
  This test covers the error handling for negative inputs. It ensures that the function behaves correctly when given invalid input by panicking with an appropriate message.

Scenario 6: Zero input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function returns 1 for the input 0, which verifies the base case for the factorial function.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 0.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test is a redundancy of Scenario 1 but is included to ensure completeness and consistency in testing.

Scenario 7: Large factorial calculation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial function with a very large input to ensure it handles extremely large calculations correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 100.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is the correct factorial of 100.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle very large inputs efficiently. It verifies that the recursive approach does not lead to stack overflow or excessive computation time for large inputs.

Scenario 8: Consecutive factorial calculations

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function can handle consecutive calculations without any issues, ensuring stability and correctness.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function multiple times with different positive integer inputs in succession.
  Assert: Verify that each return value is correct.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle consecutive calculations without any side effects or issues. It verifies the stability and correctness of the function over multiple calls.

Scenario 9: Factorial of 2

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function returns 2 for the input 2, which is a simple case to verify the recursive calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 2.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This test covers a simple case to ensure that the recursive calculation is performed correctly for a small input.

Scenario 10: Factorial of 3

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function returns 6 for the input 3, which is another simple case to verify the recursive calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 3.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 6.
Validation:
  This test covers another simple case to ensure that the recursive calculation is performed correctly for a small input.

Scenario 11: Factorial of a large negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function panics when given a large negative input, ensuring the function handles very large negative inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter -100.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "factorial is not defined for negative numbers".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles very large negative inputs by panicking with an appropriate message.

Scenario 12: Factorial of 4

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the factorial function returns 24 for the input 4, which is a simple case to verify the recursive calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the parameter 4.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 24.
Validation:
  This test covers a simple case to ensure that the recursive calculation is performed correctly for a small input.

Scenario 13: Factorial of 5

Details:
