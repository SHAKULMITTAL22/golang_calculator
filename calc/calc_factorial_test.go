FUNCTION_DEF=func Factorial(n int) int // Factorial (Recursive)

Scenario 1: Factorial of Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial of zero, which is a base case in the factorial function. The factorial of zero is defined to be 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(0).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as the factorial of zero is well-defined and expected to be 1. This test ensures that the base case is handled correctly.

Scenario 2: Factorial of One

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial of one, which is another base case in the factorial function. The factorial of one is also defined to be 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(1).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Similar to the previous test, this test ensures that the base case for one is handled correctly. The expected result is 1, which is a well-defined value.

Scenario 3: Factorial of a Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial of a positive integer greater than one. It verifies that the recursive calculation is performed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(5).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 120.
Validation:
  The factorial of 5 is 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). This test ensures that the recursive calculation is performed correctly for positive integers.

Scenario 4: Factorial of a Large Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial of a large positive integer to ensure that the function can handle large inputs without overflow or performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(20).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 2432902008176640000.
Validation:
  The factorial of 20 is a large number, and this test ensures that the function can handle large inputs correctly. It also checks for potential performance issues.

Scenario 5: Factorial of Negative Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when a negative integer is passed. The function should panic with an appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(-5).
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "factorial is not defined for negative numbers".
Validation:
  The factorial of a negative number is not defined, and the function should handle this case by panicking with a specific error message. This test ensures that the error handling for negative inputs is correct.

Scenario 6: Factorial of Large Number Close to Maximum Int

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial of a number close to the maximum value of an int to ensure that the function handles large numbers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(13).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 6227020800.
Validation:
  The factorial of 13 is a large number, and this test ensures that the function can handle numbers close to the maximum value of an int without overflow. It also checks for potential performance issues.

Scenario 7: Factorial of Maximum Int

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when the maximum value of an int is passed. The function should handle this case gracefully without overflow or panic.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(math.MaxInt).
  Assert: Verify that the result is a large positive number.
Validation:
  The factorial of the maximum value of an int is a very large number, and this test ensures that the function can handle this case gracefully without overflow or panic. It also checks for potential performance issues.

Scenario 8: Factorial of Maximum Int32

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when the maximum value of an int32 is passed. The function should handle this case gracefully without overflow or panic.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(math.MaxInt32).
  Assert: Verify that the result is a large positive number.
Validation:
  The factorial of the maximum value of an int32 is a very large number, and this test ensures that the function can handle this case gracefully without overflow or panic. It also checks for potential performance issues.

Scenario 9: Factorial of Maximum Int64

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when the maximum value of an int64 is passed. The function should handle this case gracefully without overflow or panic.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(math.MaxInt64).
  Assert: Verify that the result is a large positive number.
Validation:
  The factorial of the maximum value of an int64 is a very large number, and this test ensures that the function can handle this case gracefully without overflow or panic. It also checks for potential performance issues.

Scenario 10: Factorial of Large Number Close to Maximum Int64

Details:
  Description: This test checks the factorial of a number close to the maximum value of an int64 to ensure that the function handles large numbers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Factorial(20).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 2432902008176640000.
Validation:
  The factorial of 20 is a large number, and this test ensures that the function can handle numbers close to the maximum value of an int64 without overflow. It also checks for potential performance issues.
