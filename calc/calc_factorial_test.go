		Details:
			Description: The factorial of 0 is 1 by definition.
		Execution:
			Arrange: No setup required.
			Act: Call Factorial(0).
			Assert: Expect the result to be 1.
		Validation:
			The factorial of 0 is a base case. This test ensures that the base case is handled correctly.

		Details:
			Description: The factorial of 1 is 1 by definition.
		Execution:
			Arrange: No setup required.
			Act: Call Factorial(1).
			Assert: Expect the result to be 1.
		Validation:
			The factorial of 1 is another base case. This test ensures that the base case is handled correctly.
	`)

	t.Run("Scenario 3: Factorial of 5", `
		Details:
			Description: Calculate the factorial of a small positive integer.
		Execution:
			Arrange: No setup required.
			Act: Call Factorial(5).
			Assert: Expect the result to be 120.
		Validation:
			This test checks the correctness of the recursive calculation for a small positive integer.
	`)

	t.Run("Scenario 4: Factorial of 10", `
		Details:
			Description: Calculate the factorial of a larger positive integer.
		Execution:
			Arrange: No setup required.
			Act: Call Factorial(10).
			Assert: Expect the result to be 3628800.
		Validation:
			This test verifies the correctness of the recursive calculation for a larger positive integer, ensuring performance is acceptable.
	`)

	t.Run("Scenario 5: Factorial of negative number", `
		Details:
			Description: The function should panic when the input is a negative number.
		Execution:
			Arrange: No setup required.
			Act: Call Factorial(-5).
			Assert: Expect a panic with the message "factorial is not defined for negative numbers".
		Validation:
			This test checks that the function correctly handles invalid input by panicking with an appropriate message.
	`)

	t.Run("Scenario 6: Factorial of large number", `
		Details:
			Description: Calculate the factorial of a very large number.
		Execution:
			Arrange: No setup required.
			Act: Call Factorial(20).
			Assert: Expect the result to be 2432902008176640000.
		Validation:
			This test ensures that the function can handle large numbers without overflowing and that the result is correct.
	`)

	t.Run("Scenario 7: Factorial of max int64 value", `
		Details:
			Description: Calculate the factorial of the maximum int64 value.
		Execution:
			Arrange: No setup required.
			Act: Call Factorial(math.MaxInt64).
			Assert: Expect a panic due to stack overflow or excessive recursion.
		Validation:
			This test checks the function's behavior when the input is the maximum int64 value, ensuring it does not cause a stack overflow or excessive recursion.
	`)

	t.Run("Scenario 8: Factorial of 20 with math.BigInt", `
		Details:
			Description: Use math.BigInt to calculate the factorial of a large number to avoid overflow.
		Execution:
			Arrange: Use math.BigInt for large number arithmetic.
			Act: Call Factorial(20) with math.BigInt.
			Assert: Expect the result to be 2432902008176640000.
		Validation:
			This test ensures that the function can handle large numbers without overflowing and that the result is correct using math.BigInt.
