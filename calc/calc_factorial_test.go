FUNCTION_DEF=func Factorial(n int) int // Factorial (Recursive)

Okay, here are the Go test scenarios for the `Factorial` function, following the specified format and considering the provided context.

```
Scenario 1: Factorial of Zero

Details:
  Description: Test the base case where the input `n` is 0. According to the mathematical definition of factorial, 0! should equal 1. This also tests one of the function's explicit base case conditions (`n == 0`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input integer `n` to 0.
  Act: Call `calc.Factorial(0)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer value is equal to 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `t.Errorf` or a helper like `assert.Equal(t, 1, result)` to compare the actual result with the expected value of 1. The expected result is 1 based on the mathematical definition and the function's explicit check for `n == 0`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test is crucial because 0! = 1 is a fundamental base case for the factorial function. Getting this wrong would break the recursive calculation for many inputs and lead to incorrect results in any application relying on this factorial implementation.

```

```
Scenario 2: Factorial of One

Details:
  Description: Test the base case where the input `n` is 1. According to the mathematical definition of factorial, 1! should equal 1. This also tests the other explicit base case condition (`n == 1`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input integer `n` to 1.
  Act: Call `calc.Factorial(1)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer value is equal to 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal(t, 1, result)`. The expected result is 1 based on the mathematical definition and the function's explicit check for `n == 1`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Similar to the 0! case, 1! = 1 is another fundamental base case. Ensuring this works correctly is vital for the integrity of the recursive calculation.

```

```
Scenario 3: Factorial of a Small Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: Test the recursive calculation for a small, standard positive integer, such as 5. Factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. This tests the recursive step `n * Factorial(n-1)`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input integer `n` to 5.
  Act: Call `calc.Factorial(5)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer value is equal to 120.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal(t, 120, result)`. The expected result (120) is derived from the standard factorial calculation (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test validates the core recursive logic of the function for typical positive inputs. It ensures the function correctly multiplies descending integers until it hits the base case.

```

```
Scenario 4: Factorial of a Larger Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: Test the recursive calculation for a larger positive integer, such as 10, to ensure the recursion handles multiple steps correctly without error (within integer limits). Factorial(10) = 3,628,800.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input integer `n` to 10.
  Act: Call `calc.Factorial(10)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned integer value is equal to 3,628,800.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal(t, 3628800, result)`. The expected result is calculated as 10 * 9 * ... * 1.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test checks if the recursion performs correctly over a larger number of steps and if the result remains within the standard `int` type limits for moderately large inputs (on a 64-bit system). It provides confidence that the function works beyond trivial cases.

```

```
Scenario 5: Factorial of a Negative Integer (Panic Check)

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when provided with a negative integer input (e.g., -1). The function is defined to panic for negative inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input integer `n` to -1. Define a deferred function using `recover()` to capture potential panics.
  Act: Call `calc.Factorial(-1)` within the scope of the `defer`.
  Assert: Verify that a panic occurred. Additionally, verify that the value recovered from the panic matches the expected panic message: "factorial is not defined for negative numbers".
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use a `defer`/`recover` pattern. Assert that `recover()` returns a non-nil value, indicating a panic occurred. Further assert that the recovered value (typically an error or string) equals the specific panic message defined in the function.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test is critical for validating the function's input validation and error handling. Factorial is mathematically undefined for negative integers, and the function explicitly prevents this by panicking. Ensuring it panics as expected prevents undefined behavior or incorrect results downstream.

```

```
Scenario 6: Factorial of Another Negative Integer (Panic Consistency)

Details:
  Description: Test the function's panic behavior with a different negative integer (e.g., -10) to ensure the negative number check is robust and not specific to just -1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input integer `n` to -10. Use the `defer`/`recover()` pattern.
  Act: Call `calc.Factorial(-10)`.
  Assert: Verify that a panic occurred and that the recovered panic value matches "factorial is not defined for negative numbers".
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Similar to Scenario 5, use `defer`/`recover`. Assert that a panic occurred and the message is correct.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This reinforces the validation performed in Scenario 5, ensuring that the function consistently rejects *any* negative input, not just a specific edge case like -1. It confirms the robustness of the input validation logic (`n < 0`).
