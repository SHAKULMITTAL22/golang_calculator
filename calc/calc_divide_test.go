FUNCTION_DEF=func Divide(num1, num2 float64) float64 // Divide two floating-point numbers (with error handling)

 1: Normal Division of Positive Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Divide function by dividing two positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the Divide function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 2: Normal Division of Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Divide function by dividing two negative floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two negative floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the Divide function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 3: Division of a Positive and a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Divide function by dividing a positive and a negative floating-point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up one positive and one negative floating-point number.
  Act: Invoke the Divide function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 4: Division by Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the error handling of the Divide function when the second number is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a floating-point number and zero.
  Act: Invoke the Divide function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "division by zero is not allowed".
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 5: Division Resulting in Infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Divide function when the result is infinity (e.g., a very small number divided by a very large number).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a very small positive floating-point number and a very large positive floating-point number.
  Act: Invoke the Divide function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is positive infinity.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 6: Division Resulting in Negative Infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Divide function when the result is negative infinity (e.g., a very small negative number divided by a very large positive number).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a very small negative floating-point number and a very large positive floating-point number.
  Act: Invoke the Divide function with these numbers.

Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 9: Division of Numbers with Different Magnitudes

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Divide function when dividing numbers with different magnitudes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a small floating-point number and a large floating-point number.
  Act: Invoke the Divide function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected division of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
