FUNCTION_DEF=func Divide(num1, num2 float64) float64 // Divide two floating-point numbers (with error handling)

Scenario 1: Normal Division

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Divide function by dividing two positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call Divide with the defined numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the expected quotient.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function works correctly with typical inputs.

Scenario 2: Division by Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Divide function correctly handles the division of two negative floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call Divide with the defined numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the expected quotient.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function works correctly with negative inputs.

Scenario 3: Division by Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the error handling of the Divide function when the divisor is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a non-zero floating-point number.
  Act: Call Divide with the defined number as the dividend and zero as the divisor.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "division by zero is not allowed".
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function handles division by zero correctly.

Scenario 4: Division with Zero as Numerator

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Divide function correctly handles the case where the numerator is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a non-zero floating-point number.
  Act: Call Divide with zero as the numerator and the defined number as the divisor.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to zero.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function works correctly with zero as the numerator.

Scenario 5: Division with Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Divide function when dividing two large floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two large positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call Divide with the defined numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the expected quotient.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function handles large numbers correctly.

Scenario 6: Division with Small Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Divide function correctly handles the division of two small floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two small positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call Divide with the defined numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the expected quotient.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function works correctly with small inputs.

Scenario 7: Division with Mixed Signs

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Divide function when dividing a positive number by a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive and a negative floating-point number.
  Act: Call Divide with the defined numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to the expected quotient.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function handles mixed signs correctly.

Scenario 8: Division with Precision

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Divide function correctly handles floating-point precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two floating-point numbers that result in a non-terminating decimal.
  Act: Call Divide with the defined numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is as close as possible to the expected quotient within a margin of error.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring that the function handles floating-point precision correctly.
