FUNCTION_DEF=func Divide(num1, num2 float64) float64 // Divide two floating-point numbers (with error handling)

Okay, here are the Go test scenarios for the `calc.Divide` function, following the specified format.

```
Scenario 1: Basic Positive Division

Details:
  Description: Test the division of two positive floating-point numbers where the result is a non-integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 = 5.0, num2 = 2.0. Expected result = 2.5.
  Act: Call `calc.Divide(5.0, 2.0)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value is approximately equal to 2.5 (allowing for floating-point inaccuracies).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use a tolerance comparison (e.g., `math.Abs(expected - actual) < tolerance`) for floats.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. This validates the core functionality of the division operation for standard inputs.

```

```
Scenario 2: Division Resulting in an Integer

Details:
  Description: Test the division of two positive floating-point numbers where the result is a whole number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 = 10.0, num2 = 2.0. Expected result = 5.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Divide(10.0, 2.0)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value is approximately equal to 5.0.

```
Scenario 3: Division by Zero (Panic Scenario)

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when attempting to divide by zero, which should trigger a panic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 = 10.0, num2 = 0.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Divide(10.0, 0.0)` within a function that uses `defer` and `recover` to catch the expected panic.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 = `math.NaN()`, num2 = 2.0. Expected result = `math.NaN()`.
  Act: Call `calc.Divide(math.NaN(), 2.0)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value is NaN using `math.IsNaN(result)`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use `math.IsNaN`. Any operation involving NaN typically results in NaN.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Checks propagation of NaN values, which often indicate undefined or erroneous prior calculations.

```

```
Scenario 14: Division Involving NaN as Denominator

Details:
  Description: Test division where the denominator is NaN (Not a Number).

  Assert: Verify that the returned float64 value is NaN using `math.IsNaN(result)`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use `math.IsNaN`. Any operation involving NaN typically results in NaN.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Checks propagation of NaN values.

```

```
Scenario 15: Division of Infinity by Zero (Panic Scenario)

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when attempting to divide Infinity by zero, which should trigger a panic due to the explicit zero check.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 = `math.Inf(1)`, num2 = 0.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Divide(math.Inf(1), 0.0)` within a function that uses `defer` and `recover` to catch the expected panic.
  Assert: Verify that a panic occurred. Optionally, verify the panic message.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use `recover()`. The function's `if num2 == 0` check takes precedence over standard IEEE 754 rules for Inf/0.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Confirms that the explicit zero-division check handles all numerators, including special values, consistently.
