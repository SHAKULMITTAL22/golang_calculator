FUNCTION_DEF=func LCM(a, b int) int
Scenario 1: Normal Operation of LCM

Details:
  Description: This test scenarios covers the normal operation of the LCM function. It tests the function with two positive integers to ensure it correctly determines the least common multiple.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are providing direct input.
  Act: Call LCM with two known integer values, for example, LCM(6, 10).
  Assert: Use the testing facilities to check that the returned value is the correct least common multiple for these values, which would be 30.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on outcome of mathematical operation performed manually. This is to ensure that the LCM function correctly determines the least common multiple of two positive integers. It's an important test that covers the basic functionality of the LCM function.

Scenario 2: Edge Case with Zero Input

  Details:
    Description: This test scenarios is designed to test the function behavior when one or both of the inputs are zero.

  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are providing direct input.
    Act: Call LCM with one or both arguments as zero, for example, LCM(0, 10).
    Assert: The returned value should be zero.

  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical principle that anything multiplied by zero is zero. This scenario is crucial because it tests how the function handles zero input, which is a valid edge case in finding the least common multiple.

Scenario 3: Testing with Negative Inputs

  Details:
    Description: This test is designed to see how LCM function handles when one or both inputs are negative.

  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are providing direct input.
    Act: Invoke LCM with negative integer values, for example, LCM(-6, 10).
    Assert: Use testing utilities to check if the returned value is negative.

  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the mathematical principle that a positive multiplied by a negative is a negative. This scenario is important to ensure that the LCM function correctly handles negative inputs.

Scenario 4: Testing with Large Inputs

  Details:
    Description: This test scenario covers the operation of the LCM function with large integers. This will test if the function can handle large inputs without any overflow errors.

  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are providing direct input.
    Act: Invoke LCM with two large integers, for example, LCM(1000000, 10000000).
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the returned results.

  Validation:
    The choice of assertion would be based on predefined outcomes for some selected large numbers. This scenario assesses the function's performance and memory management with large inputs.
