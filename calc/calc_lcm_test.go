```go
Scenario 1: Basic LCM Calculation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the LCM function by calculating the LCM of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., 12 and 18.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of 12 and 18 should be 36.
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly computes the LCM for simple cases.

Scenario 2: LCM with Equal Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation when the input numbers are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two equal positive integers, e.g., 7 and 7.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of 7 and 7 should be 7.
  The test ensures that the function handles cases where the inputs are identical.

Scenario 3: LCM with One Number as 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation when one of the input numbers is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one positive integer as 1 and another positive integer, e.g., 1 and 15.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of 1 and 15 should be 15.
  The test ensures that the function handles boundary conditions involving the number 1.

Scenario 4: LCM with Both Numbers as 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation when both input numbers are 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two integers both as 1, e.g., 1 and 1.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of 1 and 1 should be 1.
  The test ensures that the function handles the base case where both inputs are 1.

Scenario 5: LCM with Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation with large input numbers to ensure performance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two large positive integers, e.g., 1000000 and 1000001.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of 1000000 and 1000001 should be 1000001000000.
  The test ensures that the function can handle large input values without performance issues.

Scenario 6: LCM with One Number as 0

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation when one of the input numbers is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one positive integer and one as 0, e.g., 0 and 12.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of 0 and 12 should be 0.
  The test ensures that the function handles cases where one input is 0.

Scenario 7: LCM with Both Numbers as 0

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation when both input numbers are 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two integers both as 0, e.g., 0 and 0.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of 0 and 0 should be 0.
  The test ensures that the function handles the case where both inputs are 0.

Scenario 8: LCM with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation with negative input numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., -6 and -8.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of -6 and -8 should be 24.
  The test ensures that the function handles negative input values correctly.

Scenario 9: LCM with One Negative and One Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM calculation with one negative and one positive input number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one negative and one positive integer, e.g., -6 and 8.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the prepared integers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned LCM is correct.
Validation:
  Assertion: The LCM of -6 and 8 should be 24.
  The test ensures that the function handles mixed sign inputs correctly.
