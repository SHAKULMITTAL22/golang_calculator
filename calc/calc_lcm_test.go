FUNCTION_DEF=func LCM(a, b int) int // Least Common Multiple (LCM) using GCD

Okay, here are the Go test scenarios for the `LCM` function, following the specified format.

```
Scenario 1: Basic Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function with two standard, positive integers where neither is a multiple of the other, and they are not coprime. This checks the fundamental calculation using the GCD.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 6`, `b = 8`. The GCD(6, 8) is 2.
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is equal to the expected mathematical LCM, which is (6 * 8) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks if the function correctly applies the formula `(a * b) / GCD(a, b)` for a common case. The expected result (24) is the smallest positive integer divisible by both 6 and 8.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This is a baseline test ensuring the core logic works correctly for typical positive inputs.

```

```
Scenario 2: Coprime Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function with two positive integers that are coprime (their GCD is 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 7`, `b = 5`. The GCD(7, 5) is 1.
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is equal to the product of `a` and `b`, which is (7 * 5) / 1 = 35.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: For coprime numbers, the LCM is simply their product. The assertion confirms the function handles this specific case correctly, implying the underlying GCD function correctly returns 1.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function works correctly when the inputs share no common factors other than 1.

```

```
Scenario 3: One Integer is a Multiple of the Other

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function where one positive integer is a direct multiple of the other.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 4`, `b = 12`. The GCD(4, 12) is 4.
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is equal to the larger number (`b`), which is (4 * 12) / 4 = 48 / 4 = 12.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: If `b` is a multiple of `a`, their LCM is `b`. The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies this relationship via the formula.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests a common mathematical property of LCM and ensures the formula holds.

```

```
Scenario 4: Equal Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function with two identical positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 10`, `b = 10`. The GCD(10, 10) is 10.
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is equal to the input number, which is (10 * 10) / 10 = 100 / 10 = 10.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The LCM of a number with itself is the number itself. The assertion confirms this basic property.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function handles identity cases correctly.

```

```
Scenario 5: One Input is Zero

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function when one of the inputs is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 9`, `b = 0`. Assuming `GCD(a, 0)` returns `a` (which is 9).
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is 0. The calculation would be (9 * 0) / GCD(9, 0) = 0 / 9 = 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Mathematically, the LCM involving zero is typically defined as 0. The assertion checks if the function adheres to this convention, assuming the underlying GCD function handles zero appropriately (e.g., `GCD(a, 0) = |a|` for `a != 0`).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Zero is a common edge case. Correct handling prevents unexpected results or errors. This test depends heavily on the behavior of the `GCD` function with zero.

```

```
Scenario 6: Both Inputs are Zero

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function when both inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 0`, `b = 0`.
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify the behavior. If `GCD(0, 0)` is defined as 0, this will lead to division by zero (`(0 * 0) / 0`), potentially causing a panic. If the function or GCD handles this specifically, the expected result might be 0 (as LCM(0, 0) is often defined as 0). The assertion should either check for the expected result (e.g., 0) or potentially test for a panic if division by zero is the expected outcome based on the `GCD` implementation. Let's assume the desired outcome is 0. Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: This tests the most extreme zero input case. The assertion for 0 assumes the function (or its dependency `GCD`) is implemented to avoid division by zero and return the conventional result for LCM(0, 0).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Critical for robustness. An unhandled division by zero would crash the program. This test clarifies the function's behavior at this singularity, highlighting the crucial dependency on how `GCD(0, 0)` is handled.

```

```
Scenario 7: One Input is Negative

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function with one positive and one negative integer. The LCM is typically defined as a positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 6`, `b = -8`. Assuming `GCD(6, -8)` returns `GCD(6, 8) = 2`.
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is the positive LCM of the absolute values, which is 24. Note: The direct formula `(a * b) / GCD(a, b)` would give `(6 * -8) / 2 = -48 / 2 = -24`. The assertion for 24 implies an expectation that the function returns the *positive* LCM, potentially requiring an absolute value operation on the final result or within the calculation if not handled by GCD.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Tests handling of mixed signs. The assertion for a positive result (24) reflects the common mathematical definition of LCM. If the function strictly implements the formula, it might return -24; the test should then be adjusted to expect -24 or the function modified.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Clarifies how the function handles negative inputs and whether it conforms to the standard definition of LCM (usually positive).

```

```
Scenario 8: Both Inputs are Negative

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function with two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = -6`, `b = -8`. Assuming `GCD(-6, -8)` returns `GCD(6, 8) = 2`.
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is the positive LCM of the absolute values, which is 24. The direct formula gives `(-6 * -8) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Checks if the function correctly handles two negative inputs. In this case, the formula naturally produces the positive LCM because the product of two negatives is positive.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures consistency in handling negative inputs and confirms the result aligns with the standard positive LCM definition.

```

```
Scenario 9: Commutativity Check

Details:
  Description: Test if the LCM function is commutative, i.e., LCM(a, b) == LCM(b, a).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set integer `a = 9`, `b = 6`.
  Act: Invoke `lcm1 = LCM(a, b)` and `lcm2 = LCM(b, a)`.
  Assert: Verify that `lcm1` is equal to `lcm2`. Both should be 18. (GCD(9, 6) = 3; (9*6)/3 = 54/3 = 18).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: LCM is a commutative operation. This test verifies that the function implementation respects this mathematical property, regardless of the order of inputs.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures predictable behavior regardless of input order, which is often expected by users or calling code.

```

```
Scenario 10: Large Integer Inputs (Potential Overflow)

Details:
  Description: Test the LCM function with large integer inputs where the intermediate multiplication `a * b` might exceed the maximum value for an `int`, potentially leading to overflow and an incorrect result, even if the final LCM is within the `int` range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select two large integers `a` and `b` such that `a * b` overflows the standard `int` type (e.g., close to `math.MaxInt` or `math.MaxInt32` depending on the system). For example, `a = math.MaxInt / 2`, `b = math.MaxInt / 3`. Calculate the expected mathematical LCM using a method that avoids overflow (e.g., using `math/big.Int` or properties like `LCM(a,b) = (|a| / GCD(a,b)) * |b|`).
  Act: Invoke `LCM(a, b)`.
  Assert: Compare the result from `LCM(a, b)` with the mathematically correct LCM calculated safely. Assert that they are *not* equal if overflow is expected to corrupt the result, or assert they *are* equal if the implementation somehow avoids intermediate overflow (unlikely for the given code). Alternatively, assert based on the expected *overflowed* result if predictable.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion aims to detect incorrect results caused by intermediate integer overflow during the `a * b` calculation. The standard `int` type has limits, and this multiplication is a common source of overflow errors.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Crucial for understanding the function's limitations and ensuring it behaves predictably (even if incorrectly due to overflow) or fails gracefully when handling very large numbers. Highlights the need for using larger integer types (like `int64` or `math/big.Int`) if large inputs are expected.
