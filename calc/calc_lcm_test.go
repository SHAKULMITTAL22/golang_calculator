FUNCTION_DEF=func LCM(a, b int) int // Least Common Multiple (LCM) using GCD

Scenario 1: Basic LCM Calculation

Details:
  Description: Validate that the LCM function correctly computes the least common multiple of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use simple positive integers as input.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct LCM.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test for verifying basic functionality.

Scenario 2: LCM of Two Equal Numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the LCM of two identical numbers is equal to the numbers themselves.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use two identical positive integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with these integers.
  Assert: Ensure the result is equal to the input numbers.
Validation:
  Explain that the LCM of identical numbers should be the number itself.
  Discuss the relevance of this test for correctness.

Scenario 3: LCM of One and Another Number

Details:
  Description: Check that the LCM of any number and 1 is the number itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use 1 and a positive integer.
  Act: Call the LCM function with 1 and the integer.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the integer.
Validation:
  Explain that 1 should not affect the LCM.
  Discuss the significance of this test for boundary conditions.

Scenario 4: LCM of Relatively Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify the LCM of two relatively prime numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use two relatively prime positive integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with these integers.
  Assert: Ensure the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  Explain that relatively prime numbers have no common divisors.
  Discuss the importance of this test for understanding the function's behavior with non-divisible inputs.

Scenario 5: LCM of Zero and Another Number

Details:
  Description: Validate that the LCM of zero and any other number is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use zero and a non-zero positive integer.
  Act: Call the LCM function with zero and the integer.
  Assert: Check that the result is zero.
Validation:
  Explain that zero is a special case where LCM should be zero.
  Discuss the relevance of this test for handling edge cases.

Scenario 6: Large Number LCM Calculation

Details:
  Description: Ensure the LCM function can handle large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use large positive integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is correct.
Validation:
  Explain that large numbers test the function's performance and accuracy.
  Discuss the importance of this test for robustness.

Scenario 7: Negative Inputs

Details:
  Description: Verify that the LCM function handles negative inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a positive and a negative integer.
  Act: Call the LCM function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is the correct LCM.
Validation:
  Explain that the LCM function should handle negative numbers gracefully.
  Discuss the relevance of this test for correctness in various scenarios.

Scenario 8: Floating Point Inputs

Details:
  Description: Validate that the LCM function does not accept floating-point inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use floating-point numbers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with these numbers.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns an appropriate error or panics.
Validation:
  Explain that the LCM function should only accept integers.
  Discuss the importance of this test for type safety.

Scenario 9: Performance with Very Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the performance of the LCM function with extremely large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use very large positive integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with these integers.
  Assert: Measure the time taken and ensure it is within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  Explain that performance testing is crucial for real-world applications.
  Discuss the relevance of this test for efficiency.

Scenario 10: Mixed Positive and Negative Inputs

Details:
  Description: Check the behavior of the LCM function with mixed positive and negative inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a mix of positive and negative integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify the correctness of the result.
Validation:
  Explain that mixed inputs should be handled correctly by the function.
  Discuss the importance of this test for comprehensive coverage.
