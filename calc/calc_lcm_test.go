FUNCTION_DEF=func LCM(a, b int) int // Least Common Multiple (LCM) using GCD

Scenario 1: Basic LCM Calculation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the LCM function by calculating the LCM of two small integers where the LCM is expected to be one of the input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(3, 5).
  Assert: Assert that the result is 15.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion checks the correctness of the basic LCM calculation. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly computes the LCM for simple cases.

Scenario 2: LCM with Common Factors

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the LCM function when both numbers have common factors other than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(12, 18).
  Assert: Assert that the result is 36.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles numbers with shared factors correctly. It is crucial for validating the LCM computation for numbers that are not coprime.

Scenario 3: LCM of Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function with large input values to ensure it can handle large numbers without overflow or precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(123456, 654321).
  Assert: Assert that the result is as expected based on the mathematical calculation.
Validation:
  This test is essential for verifying the function's performance and correctness with large inputs, which is important for real-world applications.

Scenario 4: LCM with One Number Being Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when one of the input values is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(0, 5).
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case where one of the input values is zero, which should result in an LCM of zero.

Scenario 5: LCM with Both Numbers Being Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when both input values are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(0, 0).
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test covers another edge case where both input values are zero, ensuring the function returns a reasonable result for this scenario.

Scenario 6: LCM with One Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when one of the input values is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(-4, 6).
  Assert: Assert that the result is 12.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring the function handles negative numbers correctly, as the LCM of a negative number and a positive number should be the same as the LCM of their absolute values.

Scenario 7: LCM with Both Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when both input values are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(-4, -6).
  Assert: Assert that the result is 12.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly computes the LCM for two negative numbers, which should be the same as the LCM of their absolute values.

Scenario 8: LCM with Coprime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function with two coprime numbers (numbers that have no common factors other than 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this test.
  Act: Call LCM(5, 7).
  Assert: Assert that the result is 35.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying that the function correctly calculates the LCM for coprime numbers, as the LCM in this case should be the product of the two numbers.
