FUNCTION_DEF=// Least Common Multiple (LCM) using GCD
func LCM(a, b int) int 
Scenario 1: Basic LCM Calculation
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with two positive integers where both are co-prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(5, 6).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 30.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of 5 and 6 is calculated as (5 * 6) / GCD(5, 6). Since 5 and 6 are co-prime, GCD(5, 6) is 1. Thus, (5 * 6) / 1 = 30. This test checks the basic functionality of the LCM function.

Scenario 2: LCM Calculation with Common Factors
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with two positive integers that have common factors.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(12, 18).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 36.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of 12 and 18 is calculated as (12 * 18) / GCD(12, 18). The GCD of 12 and 18 is 6. Thus, (12 * 18) / 6 = 36. This test checks the function's ability to handle numbers with common factors.

Scenario 3: LCM Calculation with One Number Being Zero
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with one of the inputs being zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(0, 5).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of any number and 0 is 0 by definition. This test checks the function's handling of zero as input.

Scenario 4: LCM Calculation with Both Numbers Being Zero
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with both inputs being zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(0, 0).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of 0 and 0 is 0 by definition. This test checks the function's handling of both inputs being zero.

Scenario 5: LCM Calculation with Large Numbers
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with large positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(1000000, 1000001).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 1000001000000.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: This test checks the function's ability to handle large numbers without overflow or precision issues.

Scenario 6: LCM Calculation with Negative Numbers
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(-12, -18).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 36.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of negative numbers should be calculated as if they were positive. The LCM of -12 and -18 is the same as the LCM of 12 and 18, which is 36. This test checks the function's handling of negative inputs.

Scenario 7: LCM Calculation with One Negative Number
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with one negative and one positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(-12, 18).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 36.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of a negative number and a positive number should be calculated as if the negative number were positive. The LCM of -12 and 18 is the same as the LCM of 12 and 18, which is 36. This test checks the function's handling of mixed sign inputs.

Scenario 8: LCM Calculation with Identical Numbers
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with two identical positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(7, 7).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 7.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of a number with itself is the number itself. The LCM of 7 and 7 is 7. This test checks the function's handling of identical inputs.

Scenario 9: LCM Calculation with Large Prime Numbers
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with two large prime numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(999983, 999989).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 999982000002.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of large prime numbers is their product since their GCD is 1. This test checks the function's ability to handle large prime numbers efficiently.

Scenario 10: LCM Calculation with One Number Being One
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with one of the inputs being 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(1, 15).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 15.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of any number and 1 is the number itself. The LCM of 1 and 15 is 15. This test checks the function's handling of 1 as input.

Scenario 11: LCM Calculation with Both Numbers Being One
Details:
  Description: Tests the LCM function with both inputs being 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call LCM(1, 1).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic: The LCM of 1 and 1 is 1 by definition. This test checks the function's handling of both inputs being 1.
