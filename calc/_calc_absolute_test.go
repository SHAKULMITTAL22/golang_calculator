FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

```
Scenario 1: Positive Number Input

Details:
  Description: The test aims to check the Absolute function when the input is a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input number to a positive value, say: 10.5
  Act: Call Absolute function with the setup number.
  Assert: The expected result is equal to the same input number i.e., 10.5.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the Absolute function will return the same number if it is positive. This test will validate that the Absolute function is working correctly for positive input numbers.



 Scenario 2: Negative Number Input

Details:
  Description: The goal of this test is to verify the Absolute function when the input is a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input number to a negative value, for example: -10.5
  Act: Invoke the Absolute function with the setup number.
  Assert: Ensure that the expected result is equal to the negative input number becoming positive i.e.,10.5.
Validation:
  If the input number is negative, the Absolute function should return it as a positive number. This test is important to verify the behavior of the Absolute function for negative input numbers, which is a standard use case.


 Scenario 3: Zero Input

Details:
  Description: The target of this test situation is to inspect the Absolute function when the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number to zero.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with the setup number.
  Assert: The expected result should be zero.
Validation:
  The assertion here is logical because the absolute value of zero is zero. So, if the function is working as expected, it should return zero for an input value of zero. This test is essential to confirm that the function is accurate when handling zero inputs.


 Scenario 4: Floating number Near to Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Absolute function with an input that is a floating number very close to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the input number to a value that is very close to zero, such as 0.000001.
  Act: Use the Absolute function with the setup number.
  Assert: The result should be 0.000001.
Validation:
  Even if the floating point number is infinitesimally small yet positive, the Absolute function should return the same number. This scenario helps to check the precision of the Absolute function.
