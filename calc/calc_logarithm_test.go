FUNCTION_DEF=func Logarithm(num, base float64) float64
Scenario 1: Positive number Logarithm test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly calculates the logarithm of a positive number with a positive base.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two float64 numbers, num as 4 and base as 2.
  Act: Invoke the "Logarithm" function with the num and base.
  Assert: Compare the result to an expected output of 2 (Since log2 4 is 2).
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the actual result is equal to the expected result, the logic is simple and straightforward. This test is important as it verifies the normal and correct operation of the function.

Scenario 2: Base is 1 Logarithm Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly panics when the base is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two float64 numbers, num as 4 and base as 1.
  Act: Invoke the "Logarithm" function with the num and base.
  Assert: Check if the function throws a panic with the expected error message "logarithm is not defined for these values".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function throws a panic with the correct message, since logarithm with base 1 is undefined. This test is important because this scenario is generally considered to be an error scenario and the function needs to handle this case properly to avoid unexpected behavior.

Scenario 3: Zero number or zero base Logarithm Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly panics when the num or the base is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two float64 numbers, both with a value of 0.
  Act: Invoke the "Logarithm" function with the num and base.
  Assert: Check if the function throws a panic with the expected error message "logarithm is not defined for these values".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function throws a panic with the correct message, since logarithm is undefined for zero. This is an important test case as this scenario will also be considered an error scenario and thus should be correctly handled by the function to avoid unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Negative number or base Logarithm Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly panics when the input number or base is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two float64 numbers, one should be negative.
  Act: Invoke the "Logarithm" function with the num and base.
  Assert: Check if the function throws a panic with the expected error message "logarithm is not defined for these values".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function throws a panic with the correct message, as the logarithm is undefined for negative numbers. This is an important test case as this scenario is generally considered an error scenario, and the function should correctly manage it.
