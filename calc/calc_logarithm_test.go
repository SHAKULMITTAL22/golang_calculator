FUNCTION_DEF=func Logarithm(num, base float64) float64 // Logarithm function (log_base of num)

Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `Logarithm` function in the `calc` package, covering normal operation, edge cases, and error handling:

```
Scenario 1: Valid Logarithm with Base 2

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to compute the logarithm of a number with a base of 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive float64 value for the number and set the base to 2.
  Act: Call the Logarithm function with the arranged number and base.
  Assert: Use the testing package to verify that the result is as expected.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function correctly computes the logarithm for a valid input.
  Importance: Validates the core functionality of the Logarithm function.

Scenario 2: Valid Logarithm with Base 10

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to compute the logarithm of a number with a base of 10.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive float64 value for the number and set the base to 10.
  Act: Call the Logarithm function with the arranged number and base.
  Assert: Use the testing package to verify that the result is as expected.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles different bases.
  Importance: Validates the function's ability to work with other common logarithmic bases.

Scenario 3: Logarithm of 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle the logarithm of 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number to 1 and define a valid base greater than 1.
  Act: Call the Logarithm function with the arranged number and base.
  Assert: Use the testing package to verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function returns 0 when the number is 1.
  Importance: Validates the function's behavior for a specific edge case.

Scenario 4: Logarithm with Base 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle an invalid base of 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive float64 value for the number and set the base to 1.
  Act: Call the Logarithm function with the arranged number and base.
  Assert: Use the testing package to verify that the function panics with the expected error message.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function panics when the base is 1, as the logarithm is not defined for this case.
  Importance: Validates the function's error handling for an invalid base.

Scenario 5: Logarithm with Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number to a negative float64 value and define a valid base greater than 1.
  Act: Call the Logarithm function with the arranged number and base.
  Assert: Use the testing package to verify that the function panics with the expected error message.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function panics when the number is negative, as the logarithm is not defined for negative numbers.
  Importance: Validates the function's error handling for an invalid number.

Scenario 6: Logarithm with Zero Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle a number of 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number to 0 and define a valid base greater than 1.
  Act: Call the Logarithm function with the arranged number and base.
  Assert: Use the testing package to verify that the function panics with the expected error message.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function panics when the number is 0, as the logarithm is not defined for 0.
  Importance: Validates the function's error handling for an invalid number.

Scenario 7: Logarithm with Negative Base

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle a negative base.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive float64 value for the number and set the base to a negative value.
  Act: Call the Logarithm function with the arranged number and base.
  Assert: Use the testing package to verify that the function panics with the expected error message.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function panics when the base is negative, as the logarithm is not defined for negative bases.
  Importance: Validates the function's error handling for an invalid base.

```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operation cases, edge cases, and error handling scenarios, ensuring comprehensive testing of the `Logarithm` function.
