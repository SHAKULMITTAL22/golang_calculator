```
Scenario 1: Test Logarithm with Standard Integer Inputs

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the `Logarithm` function with common integer inputs where the result is also an integer. It checks the basic correctness of the change of base formula implementation for a simple case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 8.0 and `base` as 2.0. The expected result is 3.0 (since 2^3 = 8).
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(8.0, 2.0)`.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or a similar assertion function (like one from `testify/assert`) to check if the returned value is approximately equal to 3.0, accounting for potential floating-point inaccuracies.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: We expect `log2(8)` to be exactly 3. Floating-point comparisons should use a tolerance (epsilon) to account for minor representation errors. `math.Abs(result - expected) < epsilon`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the fundamental logarithmic calculation is correct for straightforward, common cases.

```
```
Scenario 2: Test Logarithm with Base 10 and Integer Input

Details:
  Description: This test validates the function using base 10, a frequently used logarithmic base, with an integer input resulting in an integer output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 100.0 and `base` as 10.0. The expected result is 2.0 (since 10^2 = 100).
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(100.0, 10.0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is approximately equal to 2.0 using a suitable floating-point comparison with tolerance.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `log10(100)` is 2. Floating-point comparison with tolerance is necessary.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies correct handling of the common logarithm (base 10).

```
```
Scenario 3: Test Logarithm with Fractional Result

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle cases where the result is not an integer, requiring accurate floating-point division in the change of base formula.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 10.0 and `base` as 3.0. The expected result is `math.Log(10.0) / math.Log(3.0)`, which is approximately 2.0959.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(10.0, 3.0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is approximately equal to `math.Log(10.0) / math.Log(3.0)` (or ~2.095903) using a floating-point comparison with a small epsilon.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected result is derived directly from the change of base formula used in the function. Comparison requires tolerance due to floating-point arithmetic.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function works correctly for non-integer results, which are common in logarithmic calculations.

```
```
Scenario 4: Test Logarithm with num = 1

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the edge case where the number (`num`) is 1. The logarithm of 1 to any valid base should always be 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 1.0 and `base` as 5.0 (any valid base > 0 and != 1). The expected result is 0.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(1.0, 5.0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is approximately equal to 0.0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Mathematically, `log_b(1) = 0` for any valid base `b`. Direct comparison to 0.0 is usually safe, but using tolerance is still good practice.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Checks a fundamental property of logarithms and ensures correct handling of this specific input value.

```
```
Scenario 5: Test Logarithm with num = base

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the edge case where the number (`num`) is equal to the base. The logarithm should always be 1 in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 7.5 and `base` as 7.5. The expected result is 1.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(7.5, 7.5)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is approximately equal to 1.0 using floating-point comparison with tolerance.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Mathematically, `log_b(b) = 1` for any valid base `b`. Comparison requires tolerance.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Checks another fundamental property of logarithms.

```
```
Scenario 6: Test Logarithm Panic with num = 0

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function panics as expected when the input number (`num`) is 0, as the logarithm of 0 is undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 0.0 and `base` as 10.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(0.0, 10.0)` within a deferred function that recovers from panic.
  Assert: Assert that a panic occurred and optionally check if the panic message matches "logarithm is not defined for these values".
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function explicitly checks for `num <= 0` and panics. The test needs to catch this panic to pass.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function correctly handles invalid input according to its documented behavior (panicking), preventing undefined results or crashes later.

```
```
Scenario 7: Test Logarithm Panic with Negative num

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function panics when the input number (`num`) is negative, for which the real logarithm is undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as -5.0 and `base` as 2.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(-5.0, 2.0)` within a deferred function that recovers from panic.
  Assert: Assert that a panic occurred. Optionally verify the panic message.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function's precondition `num <= 0` triggers a panic for negative numbers. The test must detect this panic.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Confirms robust input validation for negative numbers.

```
```
Scenario 8: Test Logarithm Panic with base = 1

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function panics when the base is exactly 1, as logarithm to base 1 is undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 10.0 and `base` as 1.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(10.0, 1.0)` within a deferred function that recovers from panic.
  Assert: Assert that a panic occurred. Optionally verify the panic message.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function explicitly checks for `base == 1` and panics. The test must catch the panic.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function correctly handles the mathematically undefined case of base 1.

```
```
Scenario 9: Test Logarithm Panic with base = 0

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function panics when the base is 0, as logarithm to base 0 is undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 10.0 and `base` as 0.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(10.0, 0.0)` within a deferred function that recovers from panic.
  Assert: Assert that a panic occurred. Optionally verify the panic message.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function's precondition `base <= 0` triggers a panic for base 0. The test must detect this panic.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Confirms robust input validation for an invalid base value (0).

```
```
Scenario 10: Test Logarithm Panic with Negative base

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function panics when the base is negative, as logarithms are typically defined only for positive bases (excluding 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 10.0 and `base` as -2.0.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(10.0, -2.0)` within a deferred function that recovers from panic.
  Assert: Assert that a panic occurred. Optionally verify the panic message.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function's precondition `base <= 0` triggers a panic for negative bases. The test must detect this panic.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures input validation correctly rejects negative bases.

```
```
Scenario 11: Test Logarithm with Very Large Inputs

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with very large valid inputs to ensure numerical stability and correctness near the limits of `float64`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as `math.MaxFloat64` and `base` as 2.0. Calculate the expected result using `math.Log(math.MaxFloat64) / math.Log(2.0)`.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(math.MaxFloat64, 2.0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is approximately equal to the pre-calculated expected value, using a suitable tolerance.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Tests the limits of floating-point representation and the underlying `math.Log` function's behavior. Comparison requires tolerance.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function remains stable and reasonably accurate even with extremely large numbers.

```
```
Scenario 12: Test Logarithm with Very Small Positive Inputs (num)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with a very small positive number (`num`) close to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as `math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64` and `base` as 10.0. Calculate the expected result `math.Log(math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64) / math.Log(10.0)`.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64, 10.0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is approximately equal to the pre-calculated expected value, using a suitable tolerance. The result will be a large negative number.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Tests behavior near the lower bound of positive `float64` values. Comparison requires tolerance.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures numerical stability and correctness for inputs approaching the function's domain boundary (num > 0).

```
```
Scenario 13: Test Logarithm with Very Small Positive Inputs (base)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with a very small positive base (`base`) close to zero (but not zero or one).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num` as 0.5 and `base` as 0.1 (a value between 0 and 1). Calculate the expected result `math.Log(0.5) / math.Log(0.1)`.
  Act: Call `calc.Logarithm(0.5, 0.1)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is approximately equal to the pre-calculated expected value (approx 0.301), using a suitable tolerance.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Tests behavior with bases between 0 and 1, which is a valid input range. Comparison requires tolerance.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies correctness for less common but valid base values.
