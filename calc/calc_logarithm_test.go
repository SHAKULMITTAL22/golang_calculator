Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The logarithm with base 1 is undefined.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the base is 1.

Scenario 8: Error Handling - Logarithm of negative number with any base

Details:
  Description: This test checks the error handling of the Logarithm function when the number is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Logarithm(-10, 2).
  Assert: The function should panic with the message "logarithm is not defined for these values".
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The logarithm of a negative number is undefined.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the number is negative.
