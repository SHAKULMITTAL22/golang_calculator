FUNCTION_DEF=func Modulo(num1, num2 int) int // Modulo operation

Scenario 1: Basic Positive Modulo Operation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Modulo function with positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two positive integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, num2).
  Assert: The result should be the remainder of num1 divided by num2.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as it directly verifies the mathematical operation. This test is crucial to ensure the function performs basic arithmetic correctly.

Scenario 2: Basic Negative Modulo Operation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Modulo function with negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two negative integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, num2).
  Assert: The result should be the remainder of num1 divided by num2.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the correctness of the modulo operation with negative numbers. This is important to ensure the function handles negative inputs as expected.

Scenario 3: Mixed Sign Modulo Operation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Modulo function with one positive and one negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: One positive integer num1 and one negative integer num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, num2).
  Assert: The result should be the remainder of num1 divided by num2.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the function's behavior with mixed sign inputs. This test is crucial for ensuring the function handles diverse input scenarios correctly.

Scenario 4: Zero Divisor

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Modulo function when the divisor is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: A non-zero integer num1 and zero as num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, 0).
  Assert: The function should panic or return an error indicating division by zero.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for proper error handling when the divisor is zero. This is important to prevent runtime errors in the application.

Scenario 5: Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Modulo function with large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two large integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, num2).
  Assert: The result should be the remainder of num1 divided by num2.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures the function can handle large numbers without overflow or precision issues. This test is important for performance and stability.

Scenario 6: Divisor Larger Than Dividend

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Modulo function when the divisor is larger than the dividend.
Execution:
  Arrange: A small integer num1 and a larger integer num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, num2).
  Assert: The result should be num1 since num1 is less than num2.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the function's behavior when the divisor is larger than the dividend. This test ensures the function returns the correct remainder in such cases.

Scenario 7: Equal Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Modulo function when both numbers are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two equal integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, num2).
  Assert: The result should be zero since the remainder of dividing a number by itself is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the function's behavior when both inputs are the same. This test is important for ensuring the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 8: Large Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Modulo function with large negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two large negative integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, num2).
  Assert: The result should be the remainder of num1 divided by num2.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures the function can handle large negative numbers without issues. This test is crucial for comprehensive coverage of negative input scenarios.

Scenario 9: Positive and Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Modulo function when one number is positive and the other is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: A positive integer num1 and zero as num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, 0).
  Assert: The function should panic or return an error indicating division by zero.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for proper error handling when one input is zero. This test is important to ensure the function handles zero inputs correctly.

Scenario 10: Negative and Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Modulo function when one number is negative and the other is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: A negative integer num1 and zero as num2.
  Act: Call Modulo(num1, 0).
  Assert: The function should panic or return an error indicating division by zero.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for proper error handling when one input is zero. This test is important to ensure the function handles zero inputs correctly.
