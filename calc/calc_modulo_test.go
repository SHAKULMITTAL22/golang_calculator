FUNCTION_DEF=func Modulo(num1, num2 int) int
Scenario 1: Positive Numbers Modulo

Details:
Description: This test scenario is intended to check the Modulo operation when both input numbers are positive.
Execution:
Arrange: We need two positive numbers as input for the Modulo operation.
Act: The target function, Modulo, is invoked with two positive numbers.
Assert: Use Go testing 'Equal' to verify that the actual result matches the expected output.
Validation: The choice of assertion is simply to compare the return value which is mathematical behavior. This test is important to check the functionality of the Modulo operation when it comes to positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Negative Numbers Modulo

Details:
Description: This scenario checks the Modulo operation when both input numbers are negative.
Execution:
Arrange: We need two negative numbers for the Modulo operation.
Act: The Modulo function is called with these two negative numbers.
Assert: Use Go testing 'Equal' to ensure that the true outcome matches the expected result.
Validation: The choice of assertion was driven by mathematical correctness. This test is critical for assessing how the Modulo function deals with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Zero Number Modulo

Details:
Description: This scenario tests Modulo behavior when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Prepare one of the numbers as zero for this Modulo operation.
Act: Invoke the function Modulo with the zero and other number.
Assert: Use Go testing 'Equal' to confirm that the actual and expected outcomes are identical.
Validation: We chose this assertion to confirm that when one of the numbers is zero, the Modulo operation reverts to zero. This test is crucial for verifying the operations done on a zero value.

Scenario 4: Large Number Modulo

Details:
Description: This scenario tests the Modulo function with large numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: We need to provide two large numbers for the Modulo operation.
Act: Call the Modulo function with these two large numbers.
Assert: Use Go testing 'Equal' to check that the actual results match the expected value.
Validation: The choice of assertion is to check if the modulo operation can handle and return correct value for large numbers. This test is important for assessing the function's ability to work with large values.

Scenario 5: Small and Large Number Modulo

Details:
Description: This test checks the Modulo function's ability to handle a large number and a small number.
Execution:
Arrange: We need to supply a large number and a small number for the Modulo operation.
Act: Call the Modulo function with these a large number and a small number.
Assert: Use Go testing 'Equal' to confirm whether the actual results match the expected value.
Validation: This test is crucial to validate the mathematical correctness of the Modulo function in a case where the numbers have significant magnitude difference.
