	// Scenario 1: Basic Modulo Operation
	`
	Scenario 1: Basic Modulo Operation

	Details:
		Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Modulo function to ensure it correctly computes the remainder of a division of two integers.
	Execution:
		Arrange: Define two integers, num1 and num2.
		Act: Call the Modulo function with num1 and num2.
		Assert: Verify that the result is the expected remainder.
	Validation:
		The choice of assertion is straightforward, as the expected result can be calculated manually. This test is important as it verifies the core functionality of the Modulo function.
	`
	// Scenario 2: Modulo with Zero as Second Argument
	`
	Scenario 2: Modulo with Zero as Second Argument

	Details:
		Description: This test checks the behavior of the Modulo function when the second argument is zero, which should ideally cause a run-time panic or return an error in a well-designed function.
	Execution:
		Arrange: Define an integer num1 and set num2 to 0.
		Act: Call the Modulo function with num1 and num2.
		Assert: Expect a panic or error, depending on the implementation.
	Validation:
		This test is crucial for ensuring that the function handles division by zero gracefully, which is a common source of errors in mathematical operations.
	`
	// Scenario 3: Modulo with Negative Numbers
	`
	Scenario 3: Modulo with Negative Numbers

	Details:
		Description: This test checks the function's behavior when both arguments are negative integers.
	Execution:
		Arrange: Define two negative integers, num1 and num2.
		Act: Call the Modulo function with num1 and num2.
		Assert: Verify that the result is the expected remainder, considering the properties of modulo with negative numbers.
	Validation:
		This test ensures that the function correctly handles the modulo operation for negative numbers, which can have different results in different programming languages.
	`
	// Scenario 4: Modulo with Large Numbers
	`
	Scenario 4: Modulo with Large Numbers

	Details:
		Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the arguments are large integers, ensuring it can handle large values without performance issues or overflow.
	Execution:
		Arrange: Define two large integers, num1 and num2.
		Act: Call the Modulo function with num1 and num2.
		Assert: Verify that the result is the expected remainder.
	Validation:
		This test is important for ensuring that the function is robust and can handle large input values efficiently.
	`
	// Scenario 5: Modulo with Small Numbers
	`
	Scenario 5: Modulo with Small Numbers

	Details:
		Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the arguments are small integers, ensuring it can handle small values correctly.
	Execution:
		Arrange: Define two small integers, num1 and num2.
		Act: Call the Modulo function with num1 and num2.
		Assert: Verify that the result is the expected remainder.
	Validation:
		This test is important for ensuring that the function behaves correctly even for very small input values.
	`
	// Scenario 6: Modulo with Identical Numbers
	`
	Scenario 6: Modulo with Identical Numbers

	Details:
		Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the arguments are identical integers.
	Execution:
		Arrange: Define two identical integers, num1 and num2.
		Act: Call the Modulo function with num1 and num2.
		Assert: Verify that the result is 0, as the remainder of dividing a number by itself is always 0.
	Validation:
		This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case where the arguments are the same.
