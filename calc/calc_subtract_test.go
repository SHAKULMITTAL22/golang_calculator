FUNCTION_DEF=func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int // Subtract two integers

Scenario 1: Subtracting Two Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the correct functionality of the `Subtract` function when two positive integers are provided. It verifies that the function accurately computes the difference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the values of `num1` and `num2` to two positive integers (e.g., 10 and 5).
  Act: Call the `Subtract` function with the prepared positive integer inputs.
  Assert: Validate that the result matches the mathematical subtraction (expected result: 5).
Validation:
  Explain: The assertion is based on the fact that subtraction of positive integers is fundamental. The expected value (5) is derived from proper calculation (10 - 5). This test ensures the function correctly performs standard subtraction operations.

Scenario 2: Subtracting Two Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: This test validates the behavior of the `Subtract` function when subtracting two negative integers. It ensures that the calculation is mathematically correct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1` and `num2` to negative integers (e.g., -10 and -5).
  Act: Invoke the `Subtract` function with these negative integer inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct subtraction result, equal to -5.
Validation:
  Explain: The test is important because subtraction of negative values can result in unexpected positive numbers. Ensuring the function correctly handles negatives builds confidence in its robustness.

Scenario 3: Subtracting a Larger Integer from a Smaller One

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the `Subtract` function handles an edge case where the second number (`num2`) is greater than the first number (`num1`). It evaluates whether the function returns a negative result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign `num1` a smaller integer (e.g., 5) and `num2` a larger integer (e.g., 10).
  Act: Execute the `Subtract` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned result equals -5.
Validation:
  Explain: This test ensures that the function handles scenarios leading to negative results correctly. It verifies the accuracy of subtraction when order matters.

Scenario 4: Subtracting Zero from an Integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that subtracting zero from any integer does not change its value. This is a mathematical property of zero and must be correctly implemented.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `num1` as any integer value (e.g., 15) and set `num2` to 0.
  Act: Call the `Subtract` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the output is identical to `num1` (expected result: 15).
Validation:
  Explain: This test ensures adherence to the principle that subtracting zero has no impact. It checks for basic functionality in alignment with mathematical rules.

Scenario 5: Subtracting an Integer from Zero

Details:
  Description: This test examines the special case where a non-zero integer (`num2`) is subtracted from zero (`num1`). It ensures the function returns the negative equivalent of the integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1` as zero and `num2` as a positive integer (e.g., 7).
  Act: Call the `Subtract` function with these values.
  Assert: Verify the result is -7.
Validation:
  Explain: The assertion tests a key mathematical property where subtracting from zero produces its negative counterpart. This ensures proper handling of such cases.

Scenario 6: Subtracting Two Identical Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the `Subtract` function's behavior when two identical integers are subtracted. The result should always be zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose matching values for `num1` and `num2` (e.g., 42).
  Act: Pass both values to the `Subtract` function.
  Assert: Confirm the function returns 0.
Validation:
  Explain: Identical values should result in subtraction yielding zero. This test validates the function's basic correctness in such cases.

Scenario 7: Subtracting Large Integers

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function’s performance and correctness when subtracting very large integers. It ensures accurate computation without overflow or distortion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1` and `num2` to large integers (e.g., 1000000 and 999999).
  Act: Invoke the `Subtract` function with these values.
  Assert: Verify the result matches 1.
Validation:
  Explain: Proper subtraction of large numbers without errors guarantees reliability in handling extreme values. This test addresses scalability concerns.

Scenario 8: Subtracting Small Integers

Details:
  Description: The test verifies accurate subtraction of small integers in the range of single digits. It ensures functionality in the lower edge of the input domain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign `num1` and `num2` integer values (e.g., 2 and 1).
  Act: Call the `Subtract` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Explain: Testing small values validates the function's precision and ensures correctness at scale, regardless of input size.

Scenario 9: Subtracting Mixed Positive and Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the `Subtract` function’s ability to handle mixed input values, including a positive `num1` and negative `num2`. It verifies that the result is computed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1` to a positive integer (e.g., 5) and `num2` to a negative integer (e.g., -3).
  Act: Use the `Subtract` function with prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that the result matches the expected output (8).
Validation:
  Explain: Handling mixed values ensures correctness across all kinds of inputs. Positive and negative numbers often occur in real-world applications and need reliable handling.

Scenario 10: Subtracting Negative and Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly subtracts a positive integer (`num2`) from a negative integer (`num1`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign `num1` as a negative integer (e.g., -5) and `num2` as a positive integer (e.g., 3).
  Act: Execute the `Subtract` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Verify the outcome is consistent with mathematical subtraction (result: -8).
Validation:
  Explain: Proper management of mixed sign inputs is critical. This test guarantees consistent computation regardless of value polarity.

Scenario 11: Testing Subtraction of Large and Small Values

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates how the function handles subtraction where one number is extremely large and the other very small.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1` to a large integer (e.g., 1000000000) and `num2` to a small integer (e.g., 1).
  Act: Invoke the `Subtract` function with these values.
  Assert: Confirm the difference equals 999999999.
Validation:
  Explain: Subtraction of large discrepancies between values verifies edge cases. It ensures functionality across diverse ranges.

Scenario 12: Testing Edge Cases with Integer Overflow

Details:
  Description: This test aims to validate the function's behavior under potential overflow scenarios, especially at the boundary of integer limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `num1` as the maximum integer value (e.g., math.MaxInt32) and perform subtraction with `num2` as a small integer (e.g., 1).
  Act: Call the `Subtract` function with these values.
  Assert: Check that subtraction does not cause overflow.
Validation:
  Explain: Handling integer limits is crucial to avoid unexpected behavior. The assertion ensures the function remains stable under extreme conditions.
