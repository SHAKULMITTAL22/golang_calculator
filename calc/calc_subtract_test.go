FUNCTION_DEF=func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int // Subtract two integers

```
Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the basic subtraction functionality where the first number is larger than the second, both being positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 10`, `num2 = 4`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(10, 4)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `6`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library (like `testify/assert`) to compare the actual result with the expected value `6`. The logic is standard arithmetic subtraction (10 - 4 = 6).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This is a fundamental test case ensuring the core subtraction logic works correctly for common positive integer inputs.

```
Scenario 2: Subtracting a larger positive integer from a smaller positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles subtraction resulting in a negative number when both inputs are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 8`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(5, 8)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `-3`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `-3`. The logic follows standard arithmetic (5 - 8 = -3).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function handles negative results correctly, which is crucial for calculations involving potentially decreasing values or differences.

```
Scenario 3: Subtracting zero from a positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the identity property of subtraction where subtracting zero from a number leaves the number unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 99`, `num2 = 0`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(99, 0)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `99`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `99`. Subtracting zero should not change the minuend (99 - 0 = 99).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Confirms correct handling of zero, a common input value in many calculations.

```
Scenario 4: Subtracting a positive integer from zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies subtraction where the first number (minuend) is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 0`, `num2 = 7`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(0, 7)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `-7`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `-7`. Subtracting a positive number from zero results in the negation of that number (0 - 7 = -7).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Important for scenarios where calculations might start from a zero baseline and decrease.

```
Scenario 5: Subtracting a number from itself

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that subtracting a number from itself correctly results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 123`, `num2 = 123`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(123, 123)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `0`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `0`. Any number subtracted from itself is zero (123 - 123 = 0).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures correct handling of equality cases, often used in comparisons or change detection.

```
Scenario 6: Subtracting two negative integers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies subtraction when both input numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = -5`, `num2 = -3`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(-5, -3)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `-2`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `-2`. The logic is (-5) - (-3) = -5 + 3 = -2.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Crucial for applications dealing with negative values, such as financial calculations (debts) or temperature scales.

```
Scenario 7: Subtracting a positive integer from a negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies subtraction where the minuend is negative and the subtrahend is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = -10`, `num2 = 5`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(-10, 5)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `-15`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `-15`. The logic is -10 - 5 = -15.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures correct calculations when decreasing an already negative value.

```
Scenario 8: Subtracting a negative integer from a positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies subtraction where the minuend is positive and the subtrahend is negative (effectively addition).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 7`, `num2 = -4`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(7, -4)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `11`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `11`. Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart (7 - (-4) = 7 + 4 = 11).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies correct handling of double negatives, essential for accurate calculations involving mixed signs.

```
Scenario 9: Subtracting zero from a negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the identity property of subtraction when the minuend is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = -50`, `num2 = 0`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(-50, 0)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `-50`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `-50`. Subtracting zero should not change the minuend, even if it's negative (-50 - 0 = -50).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Reinforces the correct handling of zero across different input signs.

```
Scenario 10: Subtracting a negative integer from zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies subtraction where the minuend is zero and the subtrahend is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 0`, `num2 = -9`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(0, -9)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `9`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `9`. Subtracting a negative number from zero results in the positive counterpart of that number (0 - (-9) = 0 + 9 = 9).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures correct behavior when calculating differences relative to a zero point involving negative subtrahends.

```
Scenario 11: Subtracting involving math.MaxInt (potential overflow)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior when subtracting a negative number from the maximum possible integer value, which could lead to overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = math.MaxInt`, `num2 = -1`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(math.MaxInt, -1)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value wraps around to `math.MinInt`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `math.MinInt`. Standard Go integer types wrap around on overflow. `math.MaxInt - (-1)` is equivalent to `math.MaxInt + 1`, which exceeds the maximum value and wraps to the minimum value in two's complement representation.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests the function's behavior at the absolute upper limit of the integer type, important for systems handling very large numbers where overflow is a possibility.

```
Scenario 12: Subtracting involving math.MinInt (potential underflow)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior when subtracting a positive number from the minimum possible integer value, which could lead to underflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = math.MinInt`, `num2 = 1`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(math.MinInt, 1)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value wraps around to `math.MaxInt`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert that the result equals `math.MaxInt`. Standard Go integer types wrap around on underflow. `math.MinInt - 1` goes below the minimum value and wraps to the maximum value in two's complement representation.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests the function's behavior at the absolute lower limit of the integer type, crucial for ensuring predictable behavior even in extreme underflow conditions.

```
Scenario 13: Subtracting math.MaxInt from a small number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the result when subtracting the largest possible integer from a small positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 1`, `num2 = math.MaxInt`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(1, math.MaxInt)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to `math.MinInt + 2` (or `1 - math.MaxInt`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert the result matches the expected large negative value `1 - math.MaxInt`. This calculation should not overflow or underflow within the standard `int` range on 64-bit systems. `1 - MaxInt` results in `MinInt + 2`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies calculations involving extremely large subtrahends.

```
Scenario 14: Subtracting math.MinInt from a small number (potential overflow)

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the result when subtracting the smallest possible integer (a large negative number) from a small positive integer, testing for potential overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `num1 = 0`, `num2 = math.MinInt`.
  Act: Call `calc.Subtract(0, math.MinInt)`.
  Assert: Check if the returned value wraps around to `math.MinInt`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Assert the result equals `math.MinInt`. The operation `0 - math.MinInt` is equivalent to `0 + |math.MinInt|`. Since `|math.MinInt|` is `math.MaxInt + 1`, the result `math.MaxInt + 1` overflows and wraps around to `math.MinInt`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests another extreme boundary condition involving `math.MinInt` and potential overflow due to the subtraction resulting in a value larger than `math.MaxInt`.
