FUNCTION_DEF=func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int // Subtract two integers

Scenario 1: Basic Subtraction

Details:
  Description: The test checks the basic functionality of the Subtract function with positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(5, 3).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 2.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as it validates the core functionality of the subtraction operation.
  This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with typical inputs.

---

Scenario 2: Subtraction with Zero

Details:
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when subtracting zero from a number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(10, 0).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 10.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not alter the number when subtracting zero.
  It is crucial for ensuring the function's behavior under simple conditions.

---

Scenario 3: Subtraction with Negative Result

Details:
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when the result is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(2, 5).
  Assert: Verify that the result is -3.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles negative results.
  It is important to ensure the function's correctness when the operation results in a negative number.

---

Scenario 4: Subtraction with Negative Inputs

Details:
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when both inputs are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(-4, -2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is -2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles negative inputs correctly.
  It is important to verify that the function behaves as expected in scenarios involving negative numbers.

---

Scenario 5: Subtraction with Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the Subtract function with large positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(1000000, 500000).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 500000.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large numbers without overflow or precision issues.
  It is crucial for applications that deal with large numerical values.

---

Scenario 6: Subtraction with Max Int

Details:
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when one of the inputs is the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(math.MaxInt64, 1).
  Assert: Verify that the result is math.MaxInt64 - 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the maximum integer value correctly.
  It is important to verify that the function does not cause overflow or other issues with extreme values.

---

Scenario 7: Subtraction with Min Int

Details:
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when one of the inputs is the minimum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(math.MinInt64, 1).
  Assert: Verify that the result is math.MinInt64 - 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the minimum integer value correctly.
  It is important to verify that the function does not cause underflow or other issues with extreme values.

---

Scenario 8: Identical Inputs

Details:
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when both inputs are identical.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call Subtract(7, 7).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the scenario where the inputs are the same.
  It is important to verify that the function behaves as expected in this specific case.
