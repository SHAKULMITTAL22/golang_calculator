    Assert: Verify that the result returned by the function equals the expected value, which is 5.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The subtraction of 10 - 5 should equal 5. This test validates the basic arithmetical operation of the Subtract function.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Correct subtraction of positive integers is foundational for the application's correctness and functionality in mathematical operations.

Scenario 2: Subtract two negative integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly calculates the difference between two negative integers.

    Assert: Verify that the result returned by the function equals the expected value, which is -5.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting -10 - (-5) should yield -5, as subtracting two negatives adds the numerical difference with correct sign formatting.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Handling negative values is essential for real-life scenarios in mathematical calculations.

Scenario 3: Subtract a positive and a negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the function when subtracting a positive integer and a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide num1 = 10 and num2 = -5.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract() function with the integers.
    Assert: Ensure that the result equals 15.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting 10 - (-5) should equal 15 due to correct interpretation of negative signs. This test ensures the function handles mixed-sign inputs properly.

Scenario 6: Subtract zero from a negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that subtracting zero from a negative integer produces the correct result.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide num1 = -10 and num2 = 0.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract() function with the integers.
    Assert: Confirm the result equals -10.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting zero should yield -10, confirming proper handling of "identity elements."
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Fundamental correctness for zero cases is necessary in mathematical systems.

Scenario 7: Subtract zero from zero

Details:
  Description: Validate the systemâ€™s logical handling of subtracting zero from zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide num1 = 0 and num2 = 0.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract() function.
    Assert: Ensure the result equals 0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Zero minus zero should unequivocally equal 0, confirming the neutrality of the function for edge cases.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Demonstrates function reliability even at the smallest boundary scenarios.

Scenario 8: Subtract large integers

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's ability to handle large integer subtraction.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use num1 = math.MaxInt32 and num2 = math.MaxInt32 - 1.
    Act: Execute the Subtract() function with the integers.
    Assert: Confirm that the result equals 1.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subtracting maximal values should yield expected differences without overflow errors.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures reliability for large-scale computations.

Scenario 9: Subtract two identical integers

Details:
  Description: This test confirms the function returns zero when subtracting two identical integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide num1 = 10 and num2 = 10.
    Act: Invoke the Subtract() function.
    Assert: Validate that the result equals 0.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The subtraction of two identical integers should always equal 0, confirming basic correctness.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: A zero result for identical integers supports symmetry in function calculations.

Scenario 10: Subtract minimal integers

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's behavior with minimal integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use num1 = math.MinInt32 and num2 = math.MinInt32.
    Act: Execute the Subtract() function with the integers.
