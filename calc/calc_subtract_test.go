FUNCTION_DEF=func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int // Subtract two integers

```go
Scenario 1: Subtracting Two Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Subtract function by subtracting two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the difference between num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward since the expected result can be calculated manually. This test ensures that the function works as expected for simple arithmetic operations.

Scenario 2: Subtracting Two Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to handle subtraction of two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the difference between num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The expected result is calculated directly, ensuring that the function correctly handles negative numbers without producing incorrect results.

Scenario 3: Subtracting a Positive Integer from a Negative Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when subtracting a positive integer from a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative integer, num1, and a positive integer, num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the difference between num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function correctly performs the subtraction and returns the expected result, which can be positive or negative depending on the input values.

Scenario 4: Subtracting a Negative Integer from a Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when subtracting a negative integer from a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive integer, num1, and a negative integer, num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the difference between num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles mixed-sign operands and returns the correct result.

Scenario 5: Subtracting Zero from a Non-Zero Integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when subtracting zero from a non-zero integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a non-zero integer, num1, and zero.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and zero.
  Assert: Verify that the result is equal to num1.
Validation:
  The expected result is straightforward, and the test ensures that subtracting zero does not alter the original number.

Scenario 6: Subtracting a Non-Zero Integer from Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when subtracting a non-zero integer from zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define zero and a non-zero integer, num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with zero and num2.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the negative of num2.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function correctly handles the subtraction of a non-zero integer from zero, producing the expected negative result.

Scenario 7: Subtracting Zero from Zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when subtracting zero from zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define zero for both num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with zero and zero.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  The expected result is zero, and the test ensures that subtracting zero from zero results in zero, which is a basic arithmetic property.

Scenario 8: Subtracting Largest Int32 from Smallest Int32

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when subtracting the largest int32 value from the smallest int32 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the largest int32 value (math.MaxInt32) and the smallest int32 value (math.MinInt32).
  Act: Call the Subtract function with math.MaxInt32 and math.MinInt32.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the correct difference.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function handles the extreme values of int32 correctly, avoiding overflow or underflow issues.

Scenario 9: Subtracting Smallest Int32 from Largest Int32

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when subtracting the smallest int32 value from the largest int32 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the smallest int32 value (math.MinInt32) and the largest int32 value (math.MaxInt32).
  Act: Call the Subtract function with math.MinInt32 and math.MaxInt32.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the correct difference.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function correctly handles the reverse operation of the previous scenario, ensuring it works for both positive and negative differences.

Scenario 10: Subtracting Same Positive Integer from Itself

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when subtracting a positive integer from itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive integer, num1, and assign it to num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  The test ensures that subtracting a number from itself results in zero, which is a fundamental property of subtraction.

Scenario 11: Subtracting Same Negative Integer from Itself

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when subtracting a negative integer from itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative integer, num1, and assign it to num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  The test confirms that subtracting a negative number from itself results in zero, which aligns with the expected arithmetic behavior.
