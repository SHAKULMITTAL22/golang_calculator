FUNCTION_DEF=// Subtract two integers
func Subtract(num1, num2 int) int 
Scenario 1: Basic Subtraction

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Subtract function by subtracting two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as it verifies the correctness of the basic subtraction operation.
  This test is important to verify that the function operates correctly in the most common use case.

Scenario 2: Subtracting Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer num1 and set num2 to 0.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to num1.
Validation:
  This test verifies that subtracting zero from any number does not affect the result.
  It is crucial for validating that the function handles zero as an operand correctly.

Scenario 3: Subtracting from Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when subtracting a number from zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to 0 and define an integer num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to the negative of num2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that subtracting a number from zero produces the correct negative result.
  It is essential for validating the function's behavior when the minuend is zero.

Scenario 4: Subtracting Two Zeros

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when both numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both num1 and num2 to 0.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is zero.
Validation:
  This test verifies that subtracting zero from zero results in zero.
  It is important for validating the function's behavior in a trivial case.

Scenario 5: Subtracting Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when both numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integers, num1 and num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the subtraction of negative numbers.
  It is crucial for verifying the function's behavior in non-positive integer scenarios.

Scenario 6: Subtracting a Larger Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when subtracting a larger number from a smaller number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer num1 and a larger integer num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to the expected negative difference.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the subtraction of a larger number from a smaller number.
  It is important for validating the function's behavior when the result is a negative number.

Scenario 7: Subtracting with Maximum and Minimum Integer Values

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when using the maximum and minimum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to math.MaxInt64 and num2 to math.MinInt64.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles extreme integer values.
  It is crucial for ensuring the function's robustness and correctness in edge cases.

Scenario 8: Subtracting with Maximum Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when subtracting one from the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to math.MaxInt64 and num2 to 1.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to math.MaxInt64 - 1.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the subtraction of 1 from the maximum integer value.
  It is important for validating the function's behavior in a near-maximum integer scenario.

Scenario 9: Subtracting with Minimum Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when subtracting -1 from the minimum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set num1 to math.MinInt64 and num2 to -1.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to math.MinInt64 + 1.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the subtraction of -1 from the minimum integer value.
  It is important for validating the function's behavior in a near-minimum integer scenario.

Scenario 10: Subtracting from a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Subtract function when subtracting a positive number from a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative integer num1 and a positive integer num2.
  Act: Call the Subtract function with num1 and num2.
  Assert: Ensure the returned result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles the subtraction of a positive number from a negative number.
  It is crucial for validating the function's behavior in mixed-sign operand scenarios.
