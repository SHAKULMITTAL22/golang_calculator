FUNCTION_DEF=func Add(num1, num2 int) int // Add two integers

Okay, here are the Go test scenarios for the `Add` function in the `calc` package, following the specified format.

```
Scenario 1: Add Two Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the basic addition functionality with two positive integer inputs. It ensures that the function correctly sums standard positive numbers as expected in typical arithmetic operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integer variables, e.g., `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 10`. The expected result is `15`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library (like `testify/assert`) to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`15`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality (`result == expected`). The expected result (`15`) is the mathematical sum of `5` and `10`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This is a fundamental "happy path" test, ensuring the core functionality works correctly under normal, expected conditions. It builds confidence in the basic arithmetic capabilities.

```

```
Scenario 2: Add Two Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the addition functionality with two negative integer inputs. It ensures the function correctly handles the summation of negative values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integer variables, e.g., `num1 = -5`, `num2 = -10`. The expected result is `-15`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`-15`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result (`-15`) is the mathematical sum of `-5` and `-10`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function behaves correctly with negative numbers, which is common in many calculations (e.g., financial debits, coordinate systems).

```

```
Scenario 3: Add a Positive and a Negative Integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the addition functionality when one input is positive and the other is negative. It checks if the function correctly calculates the sum, which might result in a positive, negative, or zero value depending on the magnitudes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one positive and one negative integer, e.g., `num1 = 15`, `num2 = -7`. The expected result is `8`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`8`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result (`8`) is the mathematical sum of `15` and `-7`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests the handling of mixed-sign inputs, crucial for scenarios involving differences or balances.

```

```
Scenario 4: Add a Negative and a Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: Similar to Scenario 3, but reverses the order of positive and negative inputs to ensure commutativity isn't implicitly broken (though standard addition is commutative).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one negative and one positive integer, e.g., `num1 = -15`, `num2 = 7`. The expected result is `-8`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`-8`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result (`-8`) is the mathematical sum of `-15` and `7`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Confirms consistent behavior regardless of the order of mixed-sign operands.

```

```
Scenario 5: Add Zero to a Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the identity property of addition where adding zero to any number should result in the original number. Tests with a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive integer and zero, e.g., `num1 = 100`, `num2 = 0`. The expected result is `100`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`100`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result (`100`) follows the additive identity property (`x + 0 = x`).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function correctly handles the neutral element (zero) in addition, which can be an edge case in some implementations.

```

```
Scenario 6: Add Zero to a Negative Integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the identity property of addition with a negative integer. Adding zero should not change the negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative integer and zero, e.g., `num1 = -100`, `num2 = 0`. The expected result is `-100`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`-100`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result (`-100`) follows the additive identity property (`x + 0 = x`).
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Complements Scenario 5, ensuring the identity property holds for negative numbers as well.

```

```
Scenario 7: Add Zero to Zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the simplest case: adding zero to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define both inputs as zero, e.g., `num1 = 0`, `num2 = 0`. The expected result is `0`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`0`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result (`0`) is the mathematical sum of `0` and `0`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: A basic sanity check, ensuring the function handles the zero input correctly even when both operands are zero.

```

```
Scenario 8: Add Two Numbers Resulting in Zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the case where two numbers (additive inverses) sum to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two integers that are opposites, e.g., `num1 = 42`, `num2 = -42`. The expected result is `0`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`0`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result (`0`) occurs when adding a number and its additive inverse.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests the handling of cancellations, important in balancing accounts or net change calculations.

```

```
Scenario 9: Add Near Maximum Integer Value (No Overflow)

Details:
  Description: This test checks addition near the upper limit of the `int` type without causing an overflow. It uses `math.MaxInt` (requires `math` import in the test file).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num1 = math.MaxInt - 5`, `num2 = 3`. The expected result is `math.MaxInt - 2`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`math.MaxInt - 2`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result is the correct mathematical sum, staying within the bounds of `int`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies correct behavior at the upper boundary of the integer type, important for applications dealing with potentially large numbers.

```

```
Scenario 10: Add Near Minimum Integer Value (No Underflow)

Details:
  Description: This test checks addition near the lower limit of the `int` type without causing an underflow. It uses `math.MinInt` (requires `math` import in the test file).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num1 = math.MinInt + 5`, `num2 = -3`. The expected result is `math.MinInt + 2`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected result (`math.MinInt + 2`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality. The expected result is the correct mathematical sum, staying within the bounds of `int`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Verifies correct behavior at the lower boundary of the integer type, important for applications dealing with potentially large negative numbers.

```

```
Scenario 11: Test Potential Integer Overflow

Details:
  Description: This test explicitly checks the behavior when integer addition results in a value greater than `math.MaxInt`. In Go, this typically results in a wrap-around to negative values (specifically, `math.MaxInt + 1` becomes `math.MinInt`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num1 = math.MaxInt`, `num2 = 1`. The expected result (due to wrap-around) is `math.MinInt`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected wrap-around result (`math.MinInt`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality with the *expected wrap-around value*, not the mathematically infinite sum. Go's standard integer arithmetic defines this wrap-around behavior.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Crucial for understanding and documenting the function's behavior under overflow conditions. Depending on the application, this wrap-around might be acceptable or might indicate a need for using larger integer types (like `int64`) or specific overflow-checking logic elsewhere.

```

```
Scenario 12: Test Potential Integer Underflow

Details:
  Description: This test explicitly checks the behavior when integer addition results in a value less than `math.MinInt`. In Go, this typically results in a wrap-around to positive values (specifically, `math.MinInt - 1` becomes `math.MaxInt`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `num1 = math.MinInt`, `num2 = -1`. The expected result (due to wrap-around) is `math.MaxInt`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Add(num1, num2)` function.
  Assert: Use `t.Errorf` or an assertion library to check if the returned value is equal to the expected wrap-around result (`math.MaxInt`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks for equality with the *expected wrap-around value*. Go's standard integer arithmetic defines this wrap-around behavior for underflow as well.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Similar to overflow, this documents the underflow behavior. Applications must be aware of this wrap-around if inputs can reach these extremes.
