FUNCTION_DEF=// Add two integers
func Add(num1, num2 int) int 
Scenario 1: Basic Positive Integers Addition

  Details:
    Description: This test verifies that the Add function correctly adds two positive integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(5, 3).
    Assert: The result should be 8.
  Validation:
    The choice of assertion is straightforward as 5 + 3 equals 8. This test ensures basic functionality for typical use cases.

Scenario 2: Basic Negative Integers Addition

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the Add function correctly adds two negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(-5, -3).
    Assert: The result should be -8.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected result of -5 + -3, which is -8. This test validates the function's ability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Positive and Negative Integers Addition

  Details:
    Description: This test ensures the Add function can handle the addition of a positive and a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(5, -3).
    Assert: The result should be 2.
  Validation:
    The assertion is derived from the calculation 5 + (-3), which equals 2. This scenario tests mixed sign addition.

Scenario 4: Addition of Zero

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the Add function correctly handles the addition of zero to an integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(5, 0).
    Assert: The result should be 5.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on 5 + 0, which is 5. This test ensures the function does not alter the value when adding zero.

Scenario 5: Large Positive Integers Addition

  Details:
    Description: This test verifies that the Add function can add very large positive integers without overflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(math.MaxInt64, 1).
    Assert: The result should be math.MaxInt64 + 1.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for overflow, which is a common pitfall in addition operations. This test ensures robustness in handling large numbers.

Scenario 6: Large Negative Integers Addition

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the Add function correctly adds very large negative integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(math.MinInt64, -1).
    Assert: The result should be math.MinInt64 - 1.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures the function correctly handles large negative numbers, which is crucial for avoiding underflow.

Scenario 7: Zero and Zero Addition

  Details:
    Description: This test verifies that the Add function returns zero when both operands are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(0, 0).
    Assert: The result should be 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on 0 + 0, which is 0. This test checks the function's behavior when both inputs are zero.

Scenario 8: Maximum Integer Addition Overflow

  Details:
    Description: This test ensures that the Add function correctly handles the overflow when adding two maximum integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(math.MaxInt64, 1).
    Assert: The result should wrap around to math.MinInt64.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for the correct overflow behavior, which is essential for integer arithmetic in Go. This test ensures the function handles overflow correctly.

Scenario 9: Minimum Integer Addition Underflow

  Details:
    Description: This test verifies that the Add function correctly handles the underflow when adding two minimum integers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangements needed.
    Act: Call Add(math.MinInt64, -1).
    Assert: The result should wrap around to math.MaxInt64.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for the correct underflow behavior, which is crucial for integer arithmetic in Go. This test ensures the function handles underflow correctly.
