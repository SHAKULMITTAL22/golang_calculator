FUNCTION_DEF=func GCD(a, b int) int // Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm

Scenario 1: Normal Operation - Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the GCD function with two positive integers to ensure it returns the correct greatest common divisor.

  Arrange: Set up two positive integers, for example, 48 and 18.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters 48 and 18.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 2: Normal Operation - Equal Integers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the GCD function with two equal integers to see if it handles this case correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two equal integers, for example, 10 and 10.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters 10 and 10.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 10.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.

Scenario 4: Edge Case - One Integer Zero

Details:
  Description: The test checks the GCD function when one of the integers is zero to ensure it handles this case correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up one integer as zero and the other as a non-zero value, for example, 0 and 15.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters 0 and 15.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 15.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.

Scenario 5: Edge Case - Both Integers Zero

Details:
  Description: The test checks the GCD function when both integers are zero to ensure it handles this case correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up both integers as zero.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters 0 and 0.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 6: Normal Operation - Negative Integers

Details:

  Arrange: Set up one positive and one negative integer, for example, 48 and -18.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters 48 and -18.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 8: Edge Case - Large and Small Integers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the GCD function with a large integer and a small integer to ensure it handles this case correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a large integer and a small integer, for example, 1000000 and 5.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters 1000000 and 5.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 5.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 9: Normal Operation - Co-Prime Integers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the GCD function with two co-prime integers to ensure it returns 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two co-prime integers, for example, 17 and 23.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters 17 and 23.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 10: Edge Case - Integer Overflow

Details:
  Description: The test checks the GCD function with integers that are close to the maximum value of the int type to ensure it handles large values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two integers close to the maximum value of the int type, for example, math.MaxInt64-1 and math.MaxInt64-2.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters math.MaxInt64-1 and math.MaxInt64-2.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct GCD value.
