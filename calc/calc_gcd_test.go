FUNCTION_DEF=// Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm
func GCD(a, b int) int 
Scenario 1: GCD of two positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GCD function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the GCD function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is the correct GCD of a and b.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The expected result is precomputed based on the properties of GCD.
  Importance: This test ensures that the basic functionality of the GCD function works for typical inputs.

Scenario 2: GCD of two equal positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GCD function correctly handles the case where the two integers are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two equal positive integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the GCD function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is equal to a (or b, since they are equal).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: Since both integers are the same, their GCD should be the integer itself.
  Importance: This test verifies that the function correctly handles trivial cases where the inputs are identical.

Scenario 3: GCD of one positive integer and zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GCD function correctly handles the case where one of the integers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive integer a and set b to 0.
  Act: Call the GCD function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is equal to a.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: According to the properties of GCD, the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.
  Importance: This test ensures that the function handles the edge case where one input is zero.

Scenario 4: GCD of two zeroes

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GCD function correctly handles the case where both integers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both a and b to 0.
  Act: Call the GCD function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of 0 and 0 is conventionally defined as 0.
  Importance: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the corner case where both inputs are zero.

Scenario 5: GCD of two negative integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GCD function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the GCD function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is the absolute value of the correct GCD of a and b.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD function should return a positive result, and the test verifies this behavior.
  Importance: This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative inputs.

Scenario 6: GCD of one positive and one negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GCD function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of one positive and one negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive integer a and a negative integer b.
  Act: Call the GCD function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is the correct GCD of a and b.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The function should correctly handle mixed sign inputs and return the correct GCD.
  Importance: This test ensures that the function works correctly with mixed sign inputs.

Scenario 7: GCD of large integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the GCD function correctly handles large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two large positive integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the GCD function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the returned result is the correct GCD of a and b.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The function should handle large inputs efficiently and correctly.
  Importance: This test ensures that the function performs well with large inputs, which are common in real-world applications.
