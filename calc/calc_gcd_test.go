FUNCTION_DEF=func GCD(a, b int) int // Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm

Scenario 1: Basic GCD Calculation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the GCD function with two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(12, 18).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 6.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly computes the GCD of two positive integers.
  This test is important to ensure that the function operates correctly in a straightforward scenario.

Scenario 2: GCD with One Zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the GCD function when one of the inputs is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(0, 5).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 5.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion ensures that the function handles the case where one input is zero correctly.
  This is crucial for validating the base case of the Euclidean algorithm.

Scenario 3: GCD with Both Zeros

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the GCD function when both inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(0, 0).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 0.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function returns 0 when both inputs are zero, which is a valid mathematical outcome.
  This test ensures the function handles the edge case where both inputs are zero.

Scenario 4: GCD with Negatives

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the GCD function with negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(-12, -18).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 6.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to ensure that the function correctly handles negative inputs and returns a positive GCD.
  This test is important for verifying the robustness of the function in different scenarios.

Scenario 5: GCD with Mixed Signs

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the GCD function when one input is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(12, -18).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 6.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to ensure that the function correctly handles mixed sign inputs and returns a positive GCD.
  This test is important for verifying the function's behavior in mixed sign scenarios.

Scenario 6: Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the GCD function with large positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(123456789, 987654321).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 9.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly computes the GCD of large numbers.
  This test is important for ensuring the function's performance and correctness with large inputs.

Scenario 7: Equal Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the GCD function when both inputs are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(7, 7).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 7.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles the case where both inputs are equal.
  This test ensures the function operates correctly in a simple, edge case scenario.

Scenario 8: Relatively Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the GCD function with two relatively prime numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call GCD(10, 17).
  Assert: Expect the result to be 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to ensure that the function correctly computes the GCD for relatively prime numbers.
  This test is important for validating the function's behavior in scenarios where the GCD is 1.
