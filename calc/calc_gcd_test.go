FUNCTION_DEF=func GCD(a, b int) int // Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm

Okay, here are the test scenarios for the `GCD` function in the `calc` package, following the specified format.

```
Scenario 1: Basic Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with two standard positive integers where the greatest common divisor is greater than 1. This verifies the basic recursive step of the Euclidean algorithm.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = 54` and `b = 24`.
  Act: Call the `GCD` function: `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to the expected GCD, which is 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The Euclidean algorithm states GCD(54, 24) = GCD(24, 54 % 24) = GCD(24, 6) = GCD(6, 24 % 6) = GCD(6, 0). The base case returns `a`, which is 6. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal` to compare the actual result with the expected value 6.
  Discuss the importance of the test: This is a fundamental test case ensuring the core logic of the algorithm works correctly for typical inputs.

```

```
Scenario 2: Order of Arguments

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with the same integers as Scenario 1, but with the arguments swapped. This ensures the function produces the same result regardless of input order, as expected mathematically for GCD.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two integer variables, `a = 24` and `b = 54`.
  Act: Call the `GCD` function: `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to the expected GCD, which is 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Mathematically, GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a). The algorithm handles this: GCD(24, 54) = GCD(54, 24 % 54) = GCD(54, 24), which then proceeds as in Scenario 1. The expected result remains 6. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Verifies that the implementation correctly handles the property of commutativity for the GCD result, even if the internal steps differ slightly initially.

```

```
Scenario 3: Coprime Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with two positive integers that are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 17` and `b = 23`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: 17 and 23 are prime numbers, so their only common divisor is 1. The algorithm should correctly reduce to GCD(..., 1) and eventually GCD(1, 0), returning 1. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures the algorithm correctly identifies coprime numbers, a common case in number theory applications.

```

```
Scenario 4: One Argument is a Multiple of the Other (a > b)

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function where the first argument `a` is a multiple of the second argument `b`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 30` and `b = 10`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to `b` (which is 10).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: If `a` is a multiple of `b`, then `a % b` is 0. The algorithm proceeds: GCD(30, 10) = GCD(10, 30 % 10) = GCD(10, 0). The base case returns `a`, which is 10. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Verifies the algorithm's behavior when one number divides the other exactly, leading quickly to the base case.

```

```
Scenario 5: One Argument is a Multiple of the Other (b > a)

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function where the second argument `b` is a multiple of the first argument `a`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 7` and `b = 21`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to `a` (which is 7).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: GCD(7, 21) = GCD(21, 7 % 21) = GCD(21, 7) = GCD(7, 21 % 7) = GCD(7, 0). The base case returns `a`, which is 7. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Complements Scenario 4, ensuring correct handling regardless of which argument is the multiple.

```

```
Scenario 6: Second Argument is Zero

Details:
  Description: Test the base case of the Euclidean algorithm directly by providing 0 as the second argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 15` and `b = 0`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to `a` (which is 15).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function explicitly checks `if b == 0 { return a }`. This test directly targets this condition. The expected result is `a`. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Crucial for verifying the termination condition (base case) of the recursion.

```

```
Scenario 7: First Argument is Zero

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when the first argument is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 0` and `b = 9`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to `b` (which is 9).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: GCD(0, 9) = GCD(9, 0 % 9) = GCD(9, 0). The base case `b == 0` is hit, returning the current `a`, which is 9. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Tests an edge case involving zero and ensures the recursive step handles it correctly leading to the base case.

```

```
Scenario 8: Both Arguments are Zero

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when both arguments are 0. This is a significant edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 0` and `b = 0`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic behind the expected result: The function first checks `if b == 0`. Since `b` is 0, it immediately returns `a`, which is also 0. The modulo operation `a % b` is never reached, avoiding a potential division-by-zero panic. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Verifies the handling of the `GCD(0, 0)` case, which is often defined as 0 and ensures the implementation avoids runtime errors.

```

```
Scenario 9: Identical Positive Arguments

Details:
  Description: Test the function with two identical positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 12` and `b = 12`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to 12.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: GCD(12, 12) = GCD(12, 12 % 12) = GCD(12, 0). The base case returns `a`, which is 12. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures the algorithm works correctly when inputs are identical.

```

```
Scenario 10: One Positive, One Negative Argument (a > 0, b < 0)

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior with one positive and one negative argument. Note that the standard mathematical GCD is non-negative, but this implementation might return a negative result depending on the path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 54` and `b = -24`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to the expected value based on Go's modulo behavior. Let's trace: GCD(54, -24) -> GCD(-24, 54 % -24). `54 = (-2)*(-24) + 6`. So, `54 % -24` is 6. -> GCD(-24, 6) -> GCD(6, -24 % 6). `-24 = (-4)*6 + 0`. So, `-24 % 6` is 0. -> GCD(6, 0). Returns 6. Expected: 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The Euclidean algorithm works with negative numbers, but the sign of the remainder in Go follows the dividend (`a` in `a % b`). The trace shows the expected result is 6. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Tests edge cases involving negative numbers and relies on understanding Go's specific `%` operator behavior. It highlights that this implementation might differ from a strictly non-negative GCD definition if the inputs lead to a negative value in the `a` position when `b` becomes 0.

```

```
Scenario 11: One Negative, One Positive Argument (a < 0, b > 0)

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior with the first argument negative and the second positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = -54` and `b = 24`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to the expected value. Trace: GCD(-54, 24) -> GCD(24, -54 % 24). `-54 = (-3)*24 + 18`. So, `-54 % 24` is 18? No, Go's `%` sign follows dividend: `-54 / 24 = -2`. `-54 - (-2 * 24) = -54 - (-48) = -6`. So, `-54 % 24` is -6. -> GCD(24, -6) -> GCD(-6, 24 % -6). `24 = (-4)*(-6) + 0`. So, `24 % -6` is 0. -> GCD(-6, 0). Returns -6. Expected: -6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Tracing the execution with Go's modulo rules (`a % b` has the sign of `a`) leads to an expected result of -6. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Further explores negative input handling and the impact of Go's modulo operator sign rule on the final result. Confirms the function *can* return negative GCDs.

```

```
Scenario 12: Both Arguments Negative

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when both input arguments are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = -54` and `b = -24`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to the expected value. Trace: GCD(-54, -24) -> GCD(-24, -54 % -24). `-54 / -24 = 2`. `-54 - (2 * -24) = -54 - (-48) = -6`. So, `-54 % -24` is -6. -> GCD(-24, -6) -> GCD(-6, -24 % -6). `-24 / -6 = 4`. `-24 - (4 * -6) = -24 - (-24) = 0`. So, `-24 % -6` is 0. -> GCD(-6, 0). Returns -6. Expected: -6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Tracing with Go's modulo rules for two negative numbers leads to an expected result of -6. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Completes the testing of negative input combinations, confirming consistent behavior based on the algorithm and Go's operators.

```

```
Scenario 13: Negative Argument with Zero (a < 0, b = 0)

Details:
  Description: Test the base case with a negative first argument and zero as the second.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = -15` and `b = 0`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to `a` (which is -15).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function checks `if b == 0` first and returns `a` directly. The sign of `a` is preserved. Expected result is -15. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Verifies the base case works correctly even when the non-zero number is negative.

```

```
Scenario 14: Zero with Negative Argument (a = 0, b < 0)

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior with zero as the first argument and a negative second argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define `a = 0` and `b = -9`.
  Act: Call `result := GCD(a, b)`.
  Assert: Check if `result` is equal to `b` (which is -9).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: GCD(0, -9) -> GCD(-9, 0 % -9). `0 / -9 = 0`. `0 - (0 * -9) = 0`. So, `0 % -9` is 0. -> GCD(-9, 0). Base case returns `a`, which is -9. Expected result is -9. Use `t.Errorf` or `assert.Equal`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures the recursive step correctly handles the combination of zero and a negative number, leading to the base case with the expected (negative) value.
