FUNCTION_DEF=func GCD(a, b int) int // Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm

Sure, here are several test scenarios for the `GCD` function using Go testing practices:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Case with Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(12, 18).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 6.
Validation:
  The choice of 12 and 18 is typical and checks the basic functionality of the Euclidean algorithm. The expected result of 6 is derived from the properties of the GCD function.
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly computes the GCD for common cases.

Scenario 2: Basic Case with One Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with one of the inputs being zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(15, 0).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 15.
Validation:
  The GCD of any number and 0 should be the number itself, validating the base case of the recursive algorithm.
  This test is crucial for verifying the termination condition of the recursive function.

Scenario 3: Basic Case with Both Zeros

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with both inputs being zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(0, 0).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 0.
Validation:
  The GCD of 0 and 0 is 0, as per the mathematical definition.
  This test is important to handle a special edge case where both inputs are zero.

Scenario 4: Basic Case with Equal Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with both inputs being the same positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(10, 10).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 10.
Validation:
  The GCD of a number with itself is the number itself, validating the function's behavior for identical inputs.
  This test is important for ensuring the function handles symmetric cases correctly.

Scenario 5: Basic Case with Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(-12, -18).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 6.
Validation:
  The GCD function should handle negative numbers gracefully, as the GCD of -12 and -18 is the same as the GCD of 12 and 18.
  This test is important to verify the function's behavior with negative inputs.

Scenario 6: Basic Case with Mixed Sign Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with one positive and one negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(-12, 18).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 6.
Validation:
  The GCD function should handle mixed sign inputs correctly, as the GCD of -12 and 18 is the same as the GCD of 12 and 18.
  This test is important to verify the function's behavior with mixed sign inputs.

Scenario 7: Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with large positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(1000000, 999999).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 1.
Validation:
  The GCD of 1000000 and 999999 is 1, verifying the function's efficiency and correctness with large inputs.
  This test is important to ensure the function can handle large numbers without performance issues.

Scenario 8: Very Small Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with very small positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(1, 1).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 1.
Validation:
  The GCD of 1 and 1 is 1, verifying the function's behavior with the smallest non-zero inputs.
  This test is important to ensure the function handles very small numbers correctly.

Scenario 9: GCD with One as Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with one of the inputs being 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(1, 100).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 1.
Validation:
  The GCD of any number and 1 is always 1, verifying the function's behavior when one input is 1.
  This test is important to ensure the function handles cases where one input is 1 correctly.

Scenario 10: GCD with Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with two prime numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(17, 19).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 1.
Validation:
  The GCD of two distinct prime numbers is 1, verifying the function's behavior with prime inputs.
  This test is important to ensure the function handles prime numbers correctly.

Scenario 11: GCD with One as One of the Inputs

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with one as one of the inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(1, 5).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 1.
Validation:
  The GCD of 1 and any number is always 1, verifying the function's behavior when one input is 1.
  This test is important to ensure the function handles cases where one input is 1 correctly.

Scenario 12: GCD with Multiple Inputs

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with multiple inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(12, 18, 24).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 6.
Validation:
  The GCD of 12, 18, and 24 is 6, verifying the function's behavior with multiple inputs.
  This test is important to ensure the function handles cases with multiple inputs correctly.

Scenario 13: GCD with Negative and Positive Inputs

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD function with negative and positive inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke GCD(-12, 18, 24).
  Assert: Ensure the result is 6.
Validation:
  The GCD of -12, 18, and 24 is 6, verifying the function's behavior with negative and positive inputs.
