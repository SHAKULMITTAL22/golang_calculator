FUNCTION_DEF=func GCD(a, b int) int // Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm

Scenario 1: GCD of two positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD of two positive integers, ensuring that the function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two positive integers, a = 48 and b = 18.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters a and b.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 6.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion 6 is based on the mathematical property that the GCD of 48 and 18 is 6. This test is important to validate the basic functionality of the GCD function.

Scenario 2: GCD of two negative integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD of two negative integers, ensuring that the function correctly handles negative inputs and returns a positive GCD.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two negative integers, a = -48 and b = -18.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters a and b.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 6.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion 6 is based on the mathematical property that the GCD of -48 and -18 is 6. This test is important to validate the function's behavior with negative inputs.

Scenario 3: GCD where one integer is zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD when one of the integers is zero, ensuring that the function correctly returns the non-zero integer as the GCD.
Execution:
  Arrange: One integer is 48 and the other is 0.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters a = 48 and b = 0.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 48.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion 48 is based on the mathematical property that the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. This test is important to validate the function's behavior in edge cases.

Scenario 4: GCD of two equal positive integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD of two equal positive integers, ensuring that the function correctly returns the integer itself as the GCD.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two equal positive integers, a = 48 and b = 48.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters a and b.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 48.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion 48 is based on the mathematical property that the GCD of a number with itself is the number itself. This test is important to ensure the function handles this specific case correctly.

Scenario 5: GCD of two co-prime integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD of two co-prime integers, ensuring that the function correctly returns 1 as the GCD.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two co-prime integers, a = 13 and b = 17.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters a and b.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion 1 is based on the mathematical property that the GCD of co-prime numbers is 1. This test is important to validate the function's behavior with co-prime inputs.

Scenario 6: GCD of a larger and a smaller integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD of a larger integer and a smaller integer, ensuring that the function correctly calculates the GCD regardless of the order of inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: A larger integer a = 100 and a smaller integer b = 40.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters a and b.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 20.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion 20 is based on the mathematical property that the GCD of 100 and 40 is 20. This test is important to ensure the function handles different sizes of inputs correctly.

Scenario 7: GCD of two large integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the GCD of two large integers, ensuring that the function can handle large inputs efficiently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Two large integers, a = 123456789 and b = 987654321.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with the parameters a and b.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 3.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion 3 is based on the mathematical property that the GCD of 123456789 and 987654321 is 3. This test is important to validate the function's performance with large inputs.
