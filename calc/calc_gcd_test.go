FUNCTION_DEF=func GCD(a, b int) int // Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm

Scenario 1: Basic GCD Calculation

Details:
  Description: The test checks the basic functionality of the GCD function by calculating the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, say 48 and 18.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The expected result of 6 is derived from the properties of the Euclidean algorithm.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function correctly computes the GCD for typical positive integer inputs.

Scenario 2: GCD of Two Equal Numbers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the scenario where the GCD function is called with two equal integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two equal integers, say 36 and 36.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 36.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of two equal numbers is the number itself.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function handles the case where the inputs are identical.

Scenario 3: GCD with Zero

Details:
  Description: The test checks the scenario where one of the inputs to the GCD function is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer and zero, say 25 and 0.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 25.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of any number and zero is the number itself.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where one input is zero.

Scenario 4: GCD of Two Coprime Numbers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the scenario where the GCD function is called with two coprime integers (numbers that have no common divisors other than 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two coprime integers, say 7 and 13.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of two coprime numbers is 1.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies coprime numbers.

Scenario 5: GCD with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the scenario where the GCD function is called with negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, say -12 and -18.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 6.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of two negative numbers is the same as the GCD of their absolute values.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function handles negative inputs correctly.

Scenario 6: GCD with Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: The test checks the scenario where the GCD function is called with large integers to ensure it handles large inputs efficiently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two large integers, say 1000000 and 999999.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of 1000000 and 999999 is 1 because they are consecutive numbers.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function performs well with large inputs.

Scenario 7: GCD with One Input as One

Details:
  Description: The test checks the scenario where one of the inputs to the GCD function is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer and 1, say 35 and 1.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of any number and 1 is 1.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where one input is 1.

Scenario 8: GCD with Both Inputs as One

Details:
  Description: The test checks the scenario where both inputs to the GCD function are 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two integers both as 1.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The GCD of 1 and 1 is 1.
  Discuss the importance: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where both inputs are 1.
