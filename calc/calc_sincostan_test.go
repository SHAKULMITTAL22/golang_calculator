FUNCTION_DEF=func SinCosTan(angle float64) (sin, cos, tan float64) // Trigonometric functions (Sin, Cos, Tan)

Scenario 1: Normal Operation with 0 Degrees
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the SinCosTan function for an angle of 0 degrees. The sine of 0 degrees is 0, the cosine of 0 degrees is 1, and the tangent of 0 degrees is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: angle = 0
  Act: result := SinCosTan(angle)
  Assert: assertEqual(result.sin, 0) and assertEqual(result.cos, 1) and assertEqual(result.tan, 0)
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. For an angle of 0 degrees, the trigonometric functions return well-known values: sine is 0, cosine is 1, and tangent is 0. This test ensures that the function correctly computes these values.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the basic correctness of the function for a fundamental input.

Scenario 2: Normal Operation with 45 Degrees
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the SinCosTan function for an angle of 45 degrees. The sine of 45 degrees is approximately 0.7071, the cosine of 45 degrees is approximately 0.7071, and the tangent of 45 degrees is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: angle = 45 * math.Pi / 180
  Act: result := SinCosTan(angle)
  Assert: assertApproxEqual(result.sin, 0.7071, 0.0001) and assertApproxEqual(result.cos, 0.7071, 0.0001) and assertApproxEqual(result.tan, 1, 0.0001)
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. For an angle of 45 degrees, the trigonometric functions return values that are approximately 0.7071 for sine and cosine, and 1 for tangent. This test ensures that the function correctly computes these values with a reasonable degree of precision.
  The importance of this test is to verify the function's accuracy for a commonly used angle in trigonometry.

Scenario 3: Normal Operation with 90 Degrees
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the SinCosTan function for an angle of 90 degrees. The sine of 90 degrees is 1, the cosine of 90 degrees is 0, and the tangent of 90 degrees is undefined (infinity).
Execution:
  Arrange: angle = 90 * math.Pi / 180
  Act: result := SinCosTan(angle)
  Assert: assertEqual(result.sin, 1) and assertEqual(result.cos, 0) and assertTrue(math.IsInf(result.tan, 1))
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. For an angle of 90 degrees, the trigonometric functions return well-known values: sine is 1, cosine is 0, and tangent is infinity. This test ensures that the function correctly computes these values, including handling the infinity case for tangent.
  The importance of this test is to verify the function's behavior at a critical point in trigonometric functions.

Scenario 4: Normal Operation with 180 Degrees
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the SinCosTan function for an angle of 180 degrees. The sine of 180 degrees is 0, the cosine of 180 degrees is -1, and the tangent of 180 degrees is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: angle = 180 * math.Pi / 180
  Act: result := SinCosTan(angle)
  Assert: assertEqual(result.sin, 0) and assertEqual(result.cos, -1) and assertEqual(result.tan, 0)
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. For an angle of 180 degrees, the trigonometric functions return well-known values: sine is 0, cosine is -1, and tangent is 0. This test ensures that the function correctly computes these values.
  The importance of this test is to verify the function's correctness for another commonly used angle in trigonometry.

Scenario 5: Edge Case with Negative Angle (-45 Degrees)
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the SinCosTan function for a negative angle of -45 degrees. The sine of -45 degrees is approximately -0.7071, the cosine of -45 degrees is approximately 0.7071, and the tangent of -45 degrees is approximately -1.
Execution:
  Arrange: angle = -45 * math.Pi / 180
  Act: result := SinCosTan(angle)
  Assert: assertApproxEqual(result.sin, -0.7071, 0.0001) and assertApproxEqual(result.cos, 0.7071, 0.0001) and assertApproxEqual(result.tan, -1, 0.0001)
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. For a negative angle of -45 degrees, the trigonometric functions return values that are approximately -0.7071 for sine, 0.7071 for cosine, and -1 for tangent. This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative angles.
  The importance of this test is to verify the function's behavior with negative inputs, as trigonometric functions are periodic and should return consistent results for equivalent angles.

Scenario 6: Edge Case with Large Angle (360 Degrees)
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the SinCosTan function for an angle of 360 degrees, which is equivalent to 0 degrees. The sine of 360 degrees is 0, the cosine of 360 degrees is 1, and the tangent of 360 degrees is 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: angle = 360 * math.Pi / 180
  Act: result := SinCosTan(angle)
  Assert: assertEqual(result.sin, 0) and assertEqual(result.cos, 1) and assertEqual(result.tan, 0)
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. For an angle of 360 degrees, which is equivalent to 0 degrees due to the periodicity of trigonometric functions, the results should be the same as for 0 degrees. This test ensures that the function correctly handles large angles.
  The importance of this test is to verify the function's behavior with large inputs, as trigonometric functions are periodic and should return consistent results for equivalent angles.

Scenario 7: Edge Case with Very Large Angle (10^10 Degrees)
Details:
  Description: This test verifies the SinCosTan function for a very large angle of 10^10 degrees. The sine and cosine values will be bounded between -1 and 1, while the tangent value will approach infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: angle = math.Pow(10, 10) * math.Pi / 180
  Act: result := SinCosTan(angle)
  Assert: assertTrue(result.sin >= -1 && result.sin <= 1) and assertTrue(result.cos >= -1 && result.cos <= 1) and assertTrue(math.IsInf(result.tan, 0) || math.IsInf(result.tan, 1))
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. For very large angles, trigonometric functions are periodic and bounded. The sine and cosine values will be between -1 and 1, while the tangent value will approach infinity. This test ensures that the function correctly handles very large angles.
  The importance of this test is to verify the function's behavior with extremely large inputs, as trigonometric functions are periodic and should return consistent results for equivalent angles within the period.
