FUNCTION_DEF=func SinCosTan(angle float64) (sin, cos, tan float64) // Trigonometric functions (Sin, Cos, Tan)

Sure, here are several test scenarios for the `SinCosTan` function in the `calc` package, covering normal operation, edge cases, and error handling:

```
Scenario 1: Normal Operation - Zero Angle

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the SinCosTan function when the input angle is zero. The sine, cosine, and tangent of zero should be 0, 1, and 0 respectively.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call SinCosTan with an angle of 0.
  Assert: Verify that the returned values for sin, cos, and tan are 0, 1, and 0 respectively.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as the trigonometric values for zero are well-defined. This test ensures that the function handles the simplest case correctly.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the basic functionality of the trigonometric calculations in the function.

Scenario 2: Normal Operation - 45 Degrees

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the SinCosTan function when the input angle is 45 degrees. The sine, cosine, and tangent of 45 degrees should be approximately 0.7071, 0.7071, and 1 respectively.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call SinCosTan with an angle of 45 degrees in radians (π/4).
  Assert: Verify that the returned values for sin, cos, and tan are approximately 0.7071, 0.7071, and 1 respectively.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the known trigonometric values for 45 degrees. This test ensures that the function handles a common and important trigonometric angle correctly.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the function's accuracy for a non-trivial angle.

Scenario 3: Normal Operation - 90 Degrees

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the SinCosTan function when the input angle is 90 degrees. The sine, cosine, and tangent of 90 degrees should be approximately 1, 0, and infinity respectively.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call SinCosTan with an angle of 90 degrees in radians (π/2).
  Assert: Verify that the returned values for sin, cos, and tan are approximately 1, 0, and a very large number (representing infinity).
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the known trigonometric values for 90 degrees. This test ensures that the function handles the boundary case where tangent becomes undefined.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the function's behavior at a critical angle where tangent diverges to infinity.

Scenario 4: Normal Operation - Negative Angle

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the SinCosTan function when the input angle is negative. The sine, cosine, and tangent of a negative angle should be the negative of the corresponding positive angle.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call SinCosTan with a negative angle, e.g., -π/4.
  Assert: Verify that the returned values for sin, cos, and tan are the negative of the values for π/4.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the properties of trigonometric functions for negative angles. This test ensures that the function handles negative angles correctly.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the function's behavior for negative inputs, which is crucial for general usage.

Scenario 5: Normal Operation - Large Angle

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the SinCosTan function when the input angle is a large value. The sine, cosine, and tangent of a large angle should cycle through their periodic values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call SinCosTan with a large angle, e.g., 1000π.
  Assert: Verify that the returned values for sin, cos, and tan are within their expected periodic ranges.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the periodic nature of trigonometric functions. This test ensures that the function handles large angles correctly.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the function's behavior for large inputs, which is crucial for robust trigonometric calculations.

Scenario 6: Edge Case - Very Small Angle

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the SinCosTan function when the input angle is a very small value, close to zero. The sine, cosine, and tangent of a very small angle should be approximately the angle itself, 1, and the angle respectively.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call SinCosTan with a very small angle, e.g., 1e-10.
  Assert: Verify that the returned values for sin, cos, and tan are approximately 1e-10, 1, and 1e-10 respectively.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the small-angle approximations of trigonometric functions. This test ensures that the function handles very small angles correctly.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the function's behavior for very small inputs, which is crucial for precise trigonometric calculations.

Scenario 7: Edge Case - π/2 - Very Small Angle

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the SinCosTan function when the input angle is just below π/2. The sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle just below π/2 should be very large positive, very small positive, and very large negative respectively.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call SinCosTan with an angle just below π/2, e.g., π/2 - 1e-10.
  Assert: Verify that the returned values for sin, cos, and tan are very large positive, very small positive, and very large negative respectively.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the behavior of trigonometric functions near π/2. This test ensures that the function handles angles very close to π/2 correctly.
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the function's behavior at the critical boundary where tangent diverges to negative infinity.
