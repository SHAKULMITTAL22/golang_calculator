FUNCTION_DEF=func LCM(a, b int) int // Least Common Multiple (LCM) using GCD

Scenario 1: Basic LCM Calculation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the LCM function by calculating the LCM of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected LCM.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 2: LCM of Same Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when both input numbers are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two identical integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the same as the input numbers.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 3: LCM with One Number Being Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when one of the input numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one integer as zero and the other as a non-zero integer.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 4: LCM with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when both input numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected LCM of the absolute values of the input numbers.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 5: LCM with One Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function when one of the input numbers is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one positive integer and one negative integer.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected LCM of the absolute values of the input numbers.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 6: LCM with Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function with large input numbers to ensure it handles large values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two large integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected LCM.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 7: LCM with Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function with prime input numbers to ensure it handles prime values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two prime integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected LCM.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

Scenario 8: LCM with Co-Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the LCM function with co-prime input numbers to ensure it handles co-prime values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two co-prime integers, a and b.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the defined integers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the expected LCM.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
