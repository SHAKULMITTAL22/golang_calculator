FUNCTION_DEF=func LCM(a, b int) int // Least Common Multiple (LCM) using GCD

Scenario 1: Basic LCM Calculation

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the LCM function by calculating the LCM of two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive integers a and b.
  Act: Call the LCM function with a and b as arguments.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the correct LCM of a and b.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in verifying the core functionality of the LCM calculation.

Scenario 2: LCM with One Input Being Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the LCM function when one of the inputs is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one positive integer and set the other to zero.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero, as the LCM of any number and zero is zero.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in handling edge cases.

Scenario 3: LCM with Both Inputs Being Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the LCM function when both inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both inputs to zero.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero, as the LCM of zero and zero is zero.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in handling edge cases.

Scenario 4: LCM with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the LCM function when the inputs are negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two negative integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the negative inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the correct LCM of the absolute values of the negative inputs.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in handling negative numbers and ensuring the function behaves correctly.

Scenario 5: LCM with Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the LCM function when the inputs are large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two large integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the large inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the correct LCM of the large inputs.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in ensuring the function can handle large numbers without overflow.

Scenario 6: LCM with Co-Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the LCM function when the inputs are co-prime numbers (numbers with no common factors other than 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two co-prime integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the co-prime inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two inputs, as co-prime numbers have an LCM equal to their product.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in verifying the function's behavior with co-prime numbers.

Scenario 7: LCM with Identical Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the LCM function when both inputs are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two identical integers.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the identical inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the same as the inputs, as the LCM of identical numbers is the number itself.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in verifying the function's behavior with identical numbers.

Scenario 8: LCM with One Input Being One

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the LCM function when one of the inputs is one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define one input as one and the other as a positive integer.
  Act: Call the LCM function with the inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the other input, as the LCM of any number and one is the number itself.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of this test in handling the edge case where one input is one.
