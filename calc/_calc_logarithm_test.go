FUNCTION_DEF=// Logarithm function (log_base of num)
func Logarithm(num, base float64) float64 
Scenario 1: Basic Logarithm Calculation
Details:
  Description: Verifies that the Logarithm function correctly calculates the logarithm of a number with a given base in normal conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(10, 10)
  Assert: Expect the result to be 1.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles simple, expected inputs.
  Importance: Ensures basic functionality and correctness of the logarithm calculation.

Scenario 2: Logarithm with Different Base
Details:
  Description: Tests the Logarithm function with a different base to ensure it correctly calculates the logarithm.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(8, 2)
  Assert: Expect the result to be 3.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test checks if the function can handle different bases and return the correct result.
  Importance: Verifies the versatility and correctness of the logarithm calculation with various bases.

Scenario 3: Logarithm of 1
Details:
  Description: Verifies that the Logarithm function correctly handles the logarithm of 1 for any base.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(1, 2)
  Assert: Expect the result to be 0.
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function correctly returns 0 for the logarithm of 1, which is a mathematical property.
  Importance: Ensures the function adheres to mathematical principles for specific edge cases.

Scenario 4: Logarithm with Base 1
Details:
  Description: Tests the Logarithm function with a base of 1 to ensure it panics as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(10, 1)
  Assert: Expect a panic with the message "logarithm is not defined for these values."
Validation:
  Explanation: This test checks that the function correctly handles the undefined case of a base of 1.
  Importance: Ensures that the function enforces mathematical rules and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Scenario 5: Logarithm of Negative Number
Details:
  Description: Tests the Logarithm function with a negative number to ensure it panics as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(-10, 2)
  Assert: Expect a panic with the message "logarithm is not defined for these values."
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles invalid inputs by panicking for negative numbers.
  Importance: Verifies that the function enforces mathematical rules and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Scenario 6: Logarithm with Negative Base
Details:
  Description: Tests the Logarithm function with a negative base to ensure it panics as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(10, -2)
  Assert: Expect a panic with the message "logarithm is not defined for these values."
Validation:
  Explanation: This test checks that the function correctly handles invalid inputs by panicking for negative bases.
  Importance: Ensures that the function enforces mathematical rules and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Scenario 7: Logarithm of Zero
Details:
  Description: Tests the Logarithm function with a number of zero to ensure it panics as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(0, 2)
  Assert: Expect a panic with the message "logarithm is not defined for these values."
Validation:
  Explanation: This test ensures that the function correctly handles the undefined case of the logarithm of zero.
  Importance: Verifies that the function enforces mathematical rules and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Scenario 8: Logarithm with Zero Base
Details:
  Description: Tests the Logarithm function with a base of zero to ensure it panics as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(10, 0)
  Assert: Expect a panic with the message "logarithm is not defined for these values."
Validation:
  Explanation: This test checks that the function correctly handles the undefined case of a base of zero.
  Importance: Ensures that the function enforces mathematical rules and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

Scenario 9: Logarithm with Large Number
Details:
  Description: Tests the Logarithm function with a large number to ensure it handles large inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None
  Act: Call Logarithm(1e10, 10)
