FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Scenario 1: Test Absolute function with Positive Number

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Absolute function when positive number is passed as argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup is required for this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the Absolute function with a positive number as argument.
    Assert: Use the Equal function from Go's testing package to verify that the returned value matches the input value.
  Validation:
    In this case, both the input and expected result are same because we passed a positive number. Since the Absolute function returns the absolute value of a passed number, the return type should be same as input when a positive number is passed.
    This test scenario is important to ensure that the Absolute function correctly handles positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Test Absolute function with Negative Number

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Absolute function when negative number is passed as argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup is required for this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the Absolute function with a negative number as argument.
    Assert: Use the Equal function from Go's testing package to verify that the returned value matches the positive value of the input value.
  Validation:
    In this case, the input and expected result are not the same because we passed a negative number. Since the Absolute function returns the absolute value of a passed number, the return type should be the positive counterpart of the input when a negative number is passed.
    This test scenario is important to ensure that the Absolute function correctly handles negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test Absolute function with Zero

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to confirm that the Absolute function can correctly handle zero as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data setup required.
    Act: Invoke the Absolute function with zero as the argument.
    Assert: Use the Equal function from Go's testing package to confirm that the result is zero.
  Validation:
    This test is useful in verifying that the Absolute function can correctly handle cases where zero is the passed argument. The expected return value should be zero, as zero is neither negative nor positive.
    The assertion checks that the returned value equals the input value.
