FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Scenario 1: Test with Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns the absolute value when provided with a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No mocking or setting up of data is required as it's just a mathematical calculation.
  Act: Invoke the function Absolute with a positive number.
  Assert: The returned value should be the same as the input.
Validation:
  A positive number shouldn't be changed because it's already an absolute value. This test checks normal operations and standard functionality.

Scenario 2: Test with Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts negative numbers into their absolute form.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the function Absolute with a negative number.
  Assert: The returned value should be the positive form of the input number.
Validation:
  This test is essential to check the proper transformation of negative numbers into their absolute versions. This test is crucial to ensure overall correctness.

Scenario 3: Test with Zero

Details:
  Description: This test scenario verifies if the function can handle zero correctly, as it's neither negative nor positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional setup or mocking is required as itâ€™s a simple case of mathematical calculation.
  Act: Call the function Absolute with zero as an argument.
  Assert: Ensure the returned value is also zero.
Validation:
  Zero has special handling in many mathematical operations, and this test ensures that the function deals with it correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with a Floating Point Number

Details:
  Description: This test is created to ensure the function can correctly interpret and process floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional arrangements are required.
  Act: Call the function Absolute with a floating point number as the argument.
  Assert: The returned value should be the absolute form of the input.
Validation:
  It's essential to confirm the function can handle floating point numbers as they are a common part of mathematical operations.

Scenario 5: Test with a Very Large Negative Number

Details:
  Description: The test is to check if the function can handle very large numbers correctly. This will test the function's ability to handle edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: No initial arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the function Absolute with a very large negative number.
  Assert: The returned value should be the positive form of the input number.
Validation:
  Testing with large numbers ensures that the function can handle all possible number types in Go, and doesn't deteriorate or behave unexpectedly with larger numbers.
