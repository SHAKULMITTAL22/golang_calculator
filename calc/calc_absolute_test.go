FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Scenario 1: Zero as Input

  Details:
    Description: This test will check if the function can handle zero as an argument and return the absolute value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary in this case as we are directly passing the values.
    Act: Invoke the Absolute function with 0 as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
  Validation:
    Zero is its own absolute value, so the expected output should also be 0. This test ensures that the Absolute function can handle and return correct results for edge case inputs.

Scenario 2: Positive Number as Input

  Details:
    Description: This test is to check whether the function can handle positive numbers correctly and return the absolute value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary.
    Act: Invoke the Absolute function with a positive parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the original number.
  Validation:
    The absolute value of a positive number is the number itself, so the function should return the same value. This validates that the function implements this basic mathematical principle correctly.

Scenario 3: Negative Number as Input

  Details:
    Description: This test is to check whether the function can handle negative numbers correctly and return their absolute value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary.
    Act: Invoke the Absolute function with a negative number.
    Assert: Assert that the result is the positive version of the entered number.
  Validation:
    The absolute value of a negative number is the positive version of that number, so the function should return that number. This ensures that the function can correctly handle negative values.

Scenario 4: Large Numbers as Input

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles exceptionally large numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary.
    Act: Call the Absolute function with a large number, either negative or positive.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns the absolute value of that number.
  Validation:
    The function should be able to handle any float64 number, regardless of how large it is. This ensures that the function works as expected even with values that might potentially cause overflow errors.

Scenario 5: Very Small Number as Input

  Details:
    Description: This test is to analyze whether the function handles tiny numbers (close to zero) correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed.
    Act: Call the Absolute function with a very small number, either negative or positive.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns the absolute value of that number.
  Validation:
    The function should be able to accurately return the absolute of any small number, ensuring its broad applicability and correctness.

Repeat these tests similarly for any other scenarios deemed necessary.
