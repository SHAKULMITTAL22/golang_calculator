FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64
Scenario 1: Testing with a positive number as input

Details:
    Description: This test verifies that the function correctly outputs the absolute value of a positive number. No conversion should take place in this scenario as the input is already positive.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a positive float64 number to use as an input.
    Act: Invoke Absolute function with the positive number.
    Assert: Verify that the output equals the input number itself.
Validation:
    Since we are dealing with a positive number, no processing needs to take place. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function doesn't unnecessarily convert positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Testing with a negative number as input

Details:
    Description: This test determines the ability of the function to convert a negative number to its absolute (positive) equivalent.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a negative float64 number to use as input.
    Act: Invoke Absolute function with the negative number.
    Assert: Verify that the output is the positive equivalent of the input number.
Validation:
    The function should convert negative numbers to their positive equivalents. This is a basic requirement for any absolute function and is critical in ensuring numerical accuracy in calculations involving absolute values.

Scenario 3: Testing with zero as input

Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function can handle zero as input, and returns zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare zero to use as input.
    Act: Invoke Absolute function with zero.
    Assert: Check if the output is zero.
Validation:
    As zero is neither positive nor negative, the function should return it as is. This test is important to confirm that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing with maximum float64 value as input

Details:
    Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle the maximum float64 value (approximately 1.8e308) without overflow.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a maximum float64 value as input.
    Act: Invoke Absolute function with the maximum float64 value.
    Assert: Verify that the output equals to the input itself.
Validation:
    The test confirms that the function can handle large numbers without causing an overflow. It also ensures that the function does not perform unnecessary calculations on large positive numbers, which could result in performance issues.

Scenario 5: Testing with minimum float64 value (negative of maximum float64) as input

Details:
    Description: This test checks the function's ability to convert the smallest possible float64 number (approximately -1.8e308) to its absolute equivalent without underflow.
Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a minimum float64 value (negative of maximum float64) as input.
    Act: Invoke Absolute function with the input.
    Assert: Verify that the output equals to the absolute of the input.
Validation:
    This test validates the function's ability to handle edge cases with minimum values, and ensures that the function correctly converts these values to positive, avoiding a possible underflow. It's important to the overall integrity and robustness of the application, especially in scenarios involving large computations or data.
