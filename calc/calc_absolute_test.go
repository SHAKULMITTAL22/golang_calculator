FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Okay, here are the test scenarios for the `Absolute` function in the `calc` package.

```
Scenario 1: Test with a positive float64 input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function returns the same positive number when given a positive float64 input. It checks the basic case where no sign change is needed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive float64 variable, e.g., `input := 5.7`. Define the expected output, `expected := 5.7`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with the positive input: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use Go's testing framework (`testing.T`) to assert that `actual` is equal to `expected`. For floating-point comparisons, consider using a tolerance if precision issues are a concern, but direct comparison might suffice here. `t.Errorf("Absolute(%.2f) = %.2f; want %.2f", input, actual, expected)` if `actual != expected`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Direct equality assertion is used because the absolute value of a positive number is the number itself. No transformation is expected.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function correctly handles the simplest case and doesn't incorrectly modify positive inputs. This is fundamental for any calculation relying on absolute values.

```

```
Scenario 2: Test with a negative float64 input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function returns the positive counterpart when given a negative float64 input. It checks the core functionality of removing the negative sign.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative float64 variable, e.g., `input := -10.3`. Define the expected output, `expected := 10.3`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with the negative input: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use Go's testing framework to assert that `actual` is equal to `expected`. `t.Errorf("Absolute(%.2f) = %.2f; want %.2f", input, actual, expected)` if `actual != expected`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Direct equality assertion is used. The expected result is the input number with its sign flipped to positive, which is the definition of absolute value for negative numbers.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This is a critical test case, ensuring the function performs its primary purpose for negative numbers, which is essential in calculations involving distance, magnitude, or error measurement.

```

```
Scenario 3: Test with zero input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function correctly handles an input of zero, which should return zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable with the value zero, `input := 0.0`. Define the expected output, `expected := 0.0`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with zero: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use Go's testing framework to assert that `actual` is equal to `expected`. `t.Errorf("Absolute(%.2f) = %.2f; want %.2f", input, actual, expected)` if `actual != expected`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Direct equality assertion is used. The absolute value of zero is zero.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests the boundary condition between positive and negative numbers. Ensures zero is handled correctly as a non-negative number.

```

```
Scenario 4: Test with negative zero input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function correctly handles an input of negative zero (`-0.0`), which should return positive zero (`0.0`). Although mathematically equivalent, floating-point representations can distinguish `-0.0` and `+0.0`. `math.Abs` specifically handles this.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable with the value negative zero, `input := math.Copysign(0.0, -1.0)`. Define the expected output, `expected := 0.0`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with negative zero: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use Go's testing framework to assert that `actual` is equal to `expected` (which is positive zero). Also, potentially check that the sign bit of the result is positive using `math.Signbit(actual) == false`. `t.Errorf("Absolute(-0.0) = %.2f; want 0.0", actual)` if `actual != expected || math.Signbit(actual)`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Equality check confirms the value is 0. Checking the sign bit confirms it's positive zero, as per `math.Abs` documentation. The absolute value of `-0.0` is `+0.0`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Tests a subtle edge case in floating-point arithmetic. Ensures consistency with the standard library's `math.Abs` behavior regarding signed zero.

```

```
Scenario 5: Test with positive infinity input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function correctly handles positive infinity (`+Inf`) as input, which should return positive infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable representing positive infinity, `input := math.Inf(1)`. Define the expected output, `expected := math.Inf(1)`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with positive infinity: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use `math.IsInf(actual, 1)` to assert that the result is positive infinity. `t.Errorf("Absolute(+Inf) = %v; want +Inf", actual)` if `!math.IsInf(actual, 1)`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `math.IsInf` with a sign check (1 for positive) because direct equality comparison with infinity can be unreliable. The absolute value of positive infinity is positive infinity.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures correct handling of special floating-point values that might arise from previous calculations (e.g., division by zero).

```

```
Scenario 6: Test with negative infinity input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function correctly handles negative infinity (`-Inf`) as input, which should return positive infinity (`+Inf`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable representing negative infinity, `input := math.Inf(-1)`. Define the expected output, `expected := math.Inf(1)`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with negative infinity: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use `math.IsInf(actual, 1)` to assert that the result is positive infinity. `t.Errorf("Absolute(-Inf) = %v; want +Inf", actual)` if `!math.IsInf(actual, 1)`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `math.IsInf` with a sign check (1 for positive). The absolute value of negative infinity is positive infinity.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures correct handling of another special floating-point value, transforming negative infinity into its positive magnitude counterpart.

```

```
Scenario 7: Test with NaN input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function correctly handles NaN (Not a Number) as input, which should return NaN.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable representing NaN, `input := math.NaN()`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with NaN: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use `math.IsNaN(actual)` to assert that the result is NaN. `t.Errorf("Absolute(NaN) = %v; want NaN", actual)` if `!math.IsNaN(actual)`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Use `math.IsNaN` because NaN is never equal to anything, including itself (`NaN != NaN`). The absolute value of NaN is defined as NaN.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures correct propagation of NaN values. If an invalid operation resulted in NaN earlier, taking its absolute value should still result in NaN, preventing potential masking of errors.

```

```
Scenario 8: Test with maximum float64 value

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function handles the largest possible positive float64 value without overflow or unexpected changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable with the maximum value, `input := math.MaxFloat64`. Define the expected output, `expected := math.MaxFloat64`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with the maximum value: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use Go's testing framework to assert that `actual` is equal to `expected`. `t.Errorf("Absolute(MaxFloat64) = %v; want %v", actual, expected)` if `actual != expected`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Direct equality is used. The absolute value of the largest positive number is itself.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Checks behavior at the upper limit of the standard float64 range for positive numbers.

```

```
Scenario 9: Test with minimum (most negative) float64 value

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Absolute function handles the most negative float64 value (minimum representable value, which is `-math.MaxFloat64`), returning its positive counterpart (`math.MaxFloat64`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable with the most negative value, `input := -math.MaxFloat64`. Define the expected output, `expected := math.MaxFloat64`.
  Act: Call the `calc.Absolute` function with the minimum value: `actual := calc.Absolute(input)`.
  Assert: Use Go's testing framework to assert that `actual` is equal to `expected`. `t.Errorf("Absolute(-MaxFloat64) = %v; want %v", actual, expected)` if `actual != expected`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Direct equality is used. The absolute value of the most negative number is its positive counterpart, which is the maximum positive float64 value.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Checks behavior at the lower limit (in terms of value, largest magnitude negative) of the standard float64 range.
