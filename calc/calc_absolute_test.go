FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Scenario 1: Test Absolute with a positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when a positive number is provided. It ensures that the function returns the same positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with a positive number, e.g., 5.0.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the input value, 5.0.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as the expected behavior is that the function should return the number itself if it is positive. This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles positive inputs.

Scenario 2: Test Absolute with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when a negative number is provided. It ensures that the function returns the positive counterpart of the negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with a negative number, e.g., -3.0.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the positive equivalent of the input value, 3.0.
Validation:
  The test is crucial to verify that the function correctly converts negative numbers to their positive counterparts. This aligns with the function's purpose of returning the absolute value.

Scenario 3: Test Absolute with zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when zero is provided. It ensures that the function returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with zero, 0.0.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  Testing with zero is important to ensure the function handles the edge case where the input is zero. This test confirms that the function does not alter zero, which is its absolute value.

Scenario 4: Test Absolute with the smallest positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the smallest positive number (math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64) is provided. It ensures that the function returns the same number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function handles the smallest positive float value correctly, which is a boundary condition.

Scenario 5: Test Absolute with the largest positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the largest positive number (math.MaxFloat64) is provided. It ensures that the function returns the same number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with math.MaxFloat64.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to math.MaxFloat64.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function handles the largest positive float value correctly, which is another boundary condition.

Scenario 6: Test Absolute with NaN (Not-a-Number)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when NaN is provided. It ensures that the function returns NaN.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with math.NaN().
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is NaN.
Validation:
  Testing with NaN is important to ensure the function handles invalid numerical input correctly. This test confirms that the function does not alter NaN, which is the expected behavior.

Scenario 7: Test Absolute with positive infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when positive infinity is provided. It ensures that the function returns positive infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with math.Inf(1).
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is positive infinity.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function handles positive infinity correctly, which is a boundary condition.

Scenario 8: Test Absolute with negative infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when negative infinity is provided. It ensures that the function returns positive infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with math.Inf(-1).
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is positive infinity.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify that the function correctly converts negative infinity to positive infinity, aligning with the concept of absolute value.
