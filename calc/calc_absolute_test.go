FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `Absolute` function in the `calc` package, following the specified format:

```
Scenario 1: Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Absolute function correctly returns the absolute value of a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive float64 number.
  Act: Invoke the Absolute function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the input value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

```

```
Scenario 2: Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Absolute function correctly returns the absolute value of a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative float64 number.
  Act: Invoke the Absolute function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the positive counterpart of the input value.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

```

```
Scenario 3: Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Absolute function correctly returns zero when the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a float64 number with a value of zero.
  Act: Invoke the Absolute function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

```

```
Scenario 4: Positive Infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Absolute function correctly handles positive infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a float64 number with a value of positive infinity.
  Act: Invoke the Absolute function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is positive infinity.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

```

```
Scenario 5: Negative Infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Absolute function correctly handles negative infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a float64 number with a value of negative infinity.
  Act: Invoke the Absolute function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is positive infinity.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.

```

```
Scenario 6: NaN (Not a Number)

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Absolute function correctly handles NaN input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a float64 number with a value of NaN.
  Act: Invoke the Absolute function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is NaN.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
