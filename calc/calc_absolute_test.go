FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Scenario 1: Positive Number Test

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function works correctly with positive numbers.
Execution:
    Arrange: pass a positive number to the Absolute function.
    Act: the Absolute function will take the positive number.
    Assert: Assert that the returned result matches the input, since the absolute value of a positive number is the same.
Validation:
    The assertion is straightforward, and it checks the function's basic functionality (converting a number to its absolute value). This test is useful since it verifies that the function can successfully handle positive number inputs.

Scenario 2: Negative Number Test

Details:
    Description: This test is intended to verify if the function correctly converts negative numbers to their absolute values.
Execution:
    Arrange: pass a negative number to the Absolute function.
    Act: The Absolute function will receive a negative number.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is the same as the absolute value of the input.
Validation:
    This assertion is important because it allows us to ensure that the function correctly handles negative numbers. This would validate the requirement that the function converts negative numbers to their absolute values properly.

Scenario 3: Zero Test

Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles zero as the input value.
Execution:
    Arrange: Pass zero to the Absolute function.
    Act: The Absolute function will receive zero.
    Assert: Assert that the returned result is zero, as the absolute value of zero is zero.
Validation:
    This assertion is important because it verifies that the function properly handles zero values. This is critical because zero could be a common input to this function and should not result in any errors or incorrect outputs.

Scenario 4: Decimal Number Test

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to check if the function correctly handles decimal numbers (i.e. floats).
Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a decimal number both positive and negative to the Absolute function.
    Act: The Absolute function will receive a decimal number.
    Assert: Assert that the returned result matches the expected value based on the absolute value of the decimal number.
Validation:
    This assertion is necessary because it demonstrates that the function can handle decimal numbers. This test is important because decimal numbers are a common input to this function, and handling them correctly is a key functionality of the Absolute function.
