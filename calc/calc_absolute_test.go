FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Scenario 1: Testing positive input for the Absolute function

Details:
  Description: The aim of this test is to confirm that math.Abs returns the absolute number when a positive input is passed. The target scenario is use of the function in a normal operation with positive numbers as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function works with primitive data.
  Act: The Absolute function will be invoked with a positive float number.
  Assert: Go testing facilities will be used to verify that the actual result is equal to the expected result, which is the same positive number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check that the function indeed returns the same positive number as the absolute value. This test is important as it helps in affirming the function’s standard behavior.




Scenario 2: Testing negative input for the Absolute function

Details:
  Description: The aim of this test is to check if the Absolute function returns the absolute number as positive when a negative value is inputted. The scenario thus focuses on the function’s ability to correctly return absolute values for negative inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: We will call the function Absolute with a negative float value.
  Assert: Using the Go test assert function, we will verify that the returned value is the same value as the input, but in positive.
Validation:
  The assertion will prove that the function correctly returns the absolute value of any negative number. This is an important functionality, as taking the absolute value of a negative number is often needed in programming tasks.

Scenario 3: Testing zero input for the Absolute function

Details:
  Description: The aim of this test is to confirm that the Absolute function returns zero when zero is inputted. This ensures that absolute values of zero are accurately calculated.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Call the Absolute function with zero as the input.
  Assert: We will verify that the function returns zero as output.
Validation:
  This assertion will demonstrate the function’s proper handling of zero as input. This test is important because zero is a special number that behaves differently from other numbers in certain operations. The ability of the function to handle this special case correctly is therefore crucial.
