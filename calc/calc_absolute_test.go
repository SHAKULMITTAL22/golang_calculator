FUNCTION_DEF=func Absolute(num float64) float64 // Absolute value

Scenario 1: Testing Absolute with positive number

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function accurately computes the absolute value of a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No set up is required since we're working with a positive primitive.
  Act: Invoke Absolute function with a positive float64 number.
  Assert: Use Go testing's Equal function to verify that the actual result equals the expected outcome.
Validation:
  For this test, we expect the function will return the same positive number, as the absolute value of a positive number is the number itself. This scenario is important to validate that the function handles positive numbers correctly.


Scenario 2: Testing Absolute with negative numbers.

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function properly computes the absolute value of a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No set up is needed since we're working with a negative primitive.
  Act: Invoke Absolute function with a negative float64 number.
  Assert: Use Go testing's Equal function to verify that the actual result equals the expected outcome.
Validation:
  For this test, we expect that the function will return the positive equivalent of the negative input number, as the absolute value of a negative number is its positive counterpart. This scenario tests the key functionality of the absolute function - handling negative numbers.


Scenario 3: Testing Absolute with zero.

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the function can correctly handle zero as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No set up is necessary since we're working with zero as a primitive.
  Act: Invoke Absolute function with 0 as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing's Equal function to verify that the actual result equals the expected outcome.
Validation:
  For this test, we'd expect that the function will return 0 as the absolute value of 0 is 0. This basic scenario checks that the function can handle the edge case of a zero input correctly.


Scenario 4: Testing Absolute with large numbers.

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the function can handle large numbers correctly without overflowing.
Execution:
  Arrange: No set up necessary since we're working with a large primitive.
  Act: Invoke Absolute function with a very large float64 number as parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing's Equal function to verify that the actual result equals the expected outcome.
Validation:
  For this test, we'd expect that this function will return the same large number with no overflow errors. This scenario is important to validate that the function handles large numbers correctly, without issues of overflow.

These four scenarios cover basic functionality, including positive number, negative number, zero, and very large inputs. However, Absolute function is a wrapper function for math.Abs, which mitigates the need to test for error handling. In general, it's important to cover all possible values that the function may receive to ensure it is operating correctly under all conditions.
