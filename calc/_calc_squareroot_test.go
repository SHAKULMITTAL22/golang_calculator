FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

Scenario 1: Compute the square root of a positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly computes the square root of a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive number for testing.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify the correctness of the mathematical operation. This test is important to ensure that the function handles typical use cases accurately.

Scenario 2: Compute the square root of zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles the input of zero, which should return zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the number zero.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with zero.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function does not return an error or an incorrect value for the special case of zero. It is crucial for the function's correctness and robustness.

Scenario 3: Handle a negative number input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the SquareRoot function panics when given a negative number, as the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the negative number.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "square root of a negative number is not defined".
Validation:
  This test is essential for ensuring that the function correctly handles invalid inputs and provides meaningful error messages. It prevents the function from returning incorrect results for undefined mathematical operations.

Scenario 4: Compute the square root of a large positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly computes the square root of a large positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large positive number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the large number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify the correctness of the mathematical operation for larger inputs. This test is important to ensure that the function handles large numbers accurately without performance degradation.

Scenario 5: Compute the square root of a small positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly computes the square root of a small positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a small positive number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the small number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify the correctness of the mathematical operation for smaller inputs. This test ensures that the function handles small numbers accurately and precisely.

Scenario 6: Compute the square root of a positive number with a fractional part

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly computes the square root of a positive number with a fractional part.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive number with a fractional part.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles numbers with fractional parts correctly, which is important for the function's precision and accuracy.

Scenario 7: Compute the square root of a positive number with a decimal part

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly computes the square root of a positive number with a decimal part.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive number with a decimal part.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles numbers with decimal parts correctly, which is important for the function's precision and accuracy.

Scenario 8: Compute the square root of the maximum float64 value

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly computes the square root of the maximum float64 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the maximum float64 value (math.MaxFloat64).
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the maximum float64 value.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify the correctness of the mathematical operation for the largest possible float64 value. This test ensures that the function handles extreme values accurately without overflow or underflow.

Scenario 9: Compute the square root of the smallest positive float64 value

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly computes the square root of the smallest positive float64 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the smallest positive float64 value (math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64).
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the smallest positive float64 value.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to verify the correctness of the mathematical operation for the smallest possible non-zero float64 value. This test ensures that the function handles very small values accurately without precision loss.

Scenario 10: Handle a positive number very close to zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles a positive number that is very close to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive number very close to zero.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is equal to the expected square root.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles very small positive numbers accurately, which is important for the function's precision and robustness.
