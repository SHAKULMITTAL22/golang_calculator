FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

Here are some potential test scenarios for the mentioned function:

Scenario 1: Positive Number Square Root Test
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the 'SquareRoot' function when passed a valid positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a positive float number for the test input.
  Act: Invoke the 'SquareRoot' function with the positive number.
  Assert: Use Go’s testing facilities to ensure the function correctly returns the square root of the input.
Validation:
  The assertion for this test would be to compare the returned value from the 'SquareRoot' function against the expected output for the provided input. The logic behind the expected result is rooted in basic math principles. This test is important in ensuring the function behaves as expected with typical usage.

Scenario 2: Zero Value Test
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the 'SquareRoot' function when passed 0, an edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide 0 for the test input.
  Act: Invoke the 'SquareRoot' function with the 0.
  Assert: Use Go’s testing facilities to ensure the function correctly returns 0, as the square root of 0 is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion for this test would be to compare the returned value from 'SquareRoot' function with 0. It is important to test this scenario to ensure the function behaves as expected at its boundaries.

Scenario 3: Negative Number Panic Test
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the 'SquareRoot' function when passed a negative number and ensures it panics as expected, which tests the function's error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a negative float number for the test input.
  Act: Invoke the 'SquareRoot' function with the negative number.
  Assert: Use Go’s testing facilities to ensure the function panics with the expected error message.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the function correctly triggers a panic with the defined error message when provided with an invalid input. This test is important as it verifies that the function's error handling process is working as intended. It helps ensure the software fails gracefully under invalid or unexpected conditions.
