    Arrange: Set num1 = 5.5 and num2 = 3.2.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with num1 and num2.
    Assert: Check that the output equals 17.6.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that basic multiplication logic functions as expected. This scenario is fundamental to validating the correctness and reliability of the function.

Scenario 2: Multiply negative and positive floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: This test examines how the function handles input where one number is negative and the other is positive. It targets mixed-sign multiplication.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set num1 = -2.8 and num2 = 4.5.
    Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the inputs.
    Assert: Ensure the output matches -12.6.
  Validation:
    The expected output demonstrates that multiplication preserves signs, which is crucial for many mathematical calculations in business contexts.

Scenario 3: Multiply two negative floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: Check the behavior of the Multiply function when both inputs are negative, which should produce a positive result.

    Arrange: Set num1 = -3.6 and num2 = -7.2.
    Act: Call Multiply with these values.
    Assert: Verify the output equals 25.92.
  Validation:
    Confirming that multiplying negatives results in a positive is essential, especially for financial computations and similar applications.

Scenario 4: Multiply zero with any floating-point number

Details:
  Description: Test the scenario where one of the inputs is zero, as multiplying any number by zero should always return zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set num1 = 0.0 and num2 = 9.5.
    Act: Use Multiply to multiply the two values.
    Assert: Ensure the output is 0.0.
  Validation:
    The test highlights boundary conditions in the multiplication operation, validating that zero properly negates the result as expected.

Scenario 5: Multiply any floating-point number by one

Details:
  Description: Verify that multiplying any number by one returns the number itself, which is an important mathematical property.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set num1 = 6.4 and num2 = 1.0.
    Act: Input the values into the Multiply function.
    Assert: Confirm the output equals 6.4.
  Validation:
    This test confirms that the function respects identity properties of multiplication, ensuring consistency in primary operations.

Scenario 6: Multiply any floating-point number by negative one

Details:
  Description: Test whether multiplying a number by -1 correctly negates it.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign num1 = 11.2 and num2 = -1.0.
    Act: Pass the inputs to the Multiply function.
    Assert: Validate that the result equals -11.2.
  Validation:
    This case confirms proper handling of negation through multiplication, which is critical in reversing financial and other numerical values.

Scenario 7: Multiply two very small floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the function's precision and handling of very small float numbers close to zero.

    Arrange: Set num1 = 0.00003 and num2 = 0.00007.
    Act: Multiply these numbers using the Multiply function.
    Assert: Verify the output equals 0.0000000021.
  Validation:
    This test evaluates how accurately the function handles underflow or very small numbers, critical for scientific and high-precision applications.

Scenario 8: Multiply two very large floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle large numbers without overflow.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign num1 = 1e+10 and num2 = 2e+10.
    Act: Call Multiply with these parameters.
    Assert: Confirm the output equals 2e+20.
  Validation:
    The test ensures that the function operates correctly for large-scale computations, an essential feature for applications in data science and finance.

Scenario 9: Multiply a positive and a fractional negative number

Details:
  Description: Test the function's handling of inputs when one is a fractional negative number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set num1 = 9.5 and num2 = -0.2.
    Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the inputs.
    Assert: Validate the output matches -1.9.
  Validation:
    The test explores mixed-sign fractional inputs, ensuring correct handling of edge cases in real-world numerical scenarios.

Scenario 10: Multiply two fractional positive floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: Check the result when multiplying two fractional positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set num1 = 0.5 and num2 = 0.5.
    Act: Execute Multiply with these values.
    Assert: Confirm the result equals 0.25.
  Validation:
    Assures that the function accurately handles fractional inputs, important for calculations involving rates or proportions.

Scenario 11: Multiply NaN (Not a Number) and a valid float

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when one of the inputs is NaN, as multiplying a NaN with any number should yield NaN according to IEEE standards.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use math.NaN() for num1 and set num2 = 3.5.
    Act: Call Multiply with the inputs.
    Assert: Confirm the result is NaN.
  Validation:
    This test verifies compliance with floating-point standards, ensuring proper handling of undefined or invalid numerical states.

Scenario 12: Multiply infinity with a finite floating-point number

Details:
  Description: Test multiplication involving infinity, ensuring it adheres to mathematical conventions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Utilize math.Inf(1) for num1 and set num2 = 8.5.
    Act: Invoke the Multiply function.
    Assert: Ensure the result is math.Inf(1).
  Validation:
    The test ensures proper handling of infinite values, critical for advanced computational or analytical tasks relying on extended numerical domains.

Scenario 13: Multiply infinity with -infinity

Details:
  Description: Check multiplication of positive infinity with negative infinity to verify the expected mathematical result.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Assign num1 = math.Inf(1) and num2 = math.Inf(-1).
    Act: Process these inputs through Multiply.
    Assert: Validate the result equals -math.Inf(1).

    Arrange: Assign num1 = 0.0 and num2 = math.Inf(1).
    Act: Submit these numbers to Multiply.
    Assert: Confirm the output equals NaN.
  Validation:
    Ensures robust handling of invalid mathematical states, safeguarding high-precision computations against undefined results.
