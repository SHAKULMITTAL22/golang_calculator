FUNCTION_DEF=func Multiply(num1, num2 float64) float64 // Multiply two floating-point numbers

Scenario 1: Multiplying two positive numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly computes the product of two positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define two positive float64 numbers as inputs, e.g., num1 = 3.5 and num2 = 2.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these values.
    Assert: Confirm that the result matches the expected value, which in this case is 7.0 (3.5 × 2.0).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying two positive numbers is a standard operation, and the result should always be positive and accurate. This test ensures correctness in simple cases important for many business calculations.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the essential functionality works correctly for common inputs used in multiplication scenarios.

Scenario 2: Multiplying two negative numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function produces a positive result when multiplying two negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use two negative float64 numbers as inputs, e.g., num1 = -4.5 and num2 = -2.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these inputs.
    Assert: Validate that the result is positive and equals 9.0 (-4.5 × -2.0).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: When multiplying two negative numbers, the result must be positive according to standard mathematical rules. Ensuring this prevents unexpected errors in calculations.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Critical for applications that rely on mathematical consistency and correctness for negative values.

Scenario 3: Multiplying a positive number and a negative number

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function correctly computes the product of a positive and a negative number, resulting in a negative value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a positive number (e.g., num1 = 5.0) and a negative number (e.g., num2 = -3.0).
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check that the result equals -15.0 (5.0 × -3.0).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplication of a positive and negative number must result in a negative number. This test ensures proper handling of mixed signs.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Prevents logical errors that could arise in applications involving financial loss or profit calculations.

Scenario 4: Multiplying a number by zero

Details:
  Description: Validate that any number multiplied by zero results in zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use zero (e.g., num2 = 0.0) and another number (e.g., num1 = 10.0).
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these values.
    Assert: Confirm that the result matches 0.0 (10.0 × 0.0).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplication by zero always yields zero, irrespective of the other operand. This is fundamental in mathematics and ensures accuracy in edge cases.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Prevents unexpected results in cases where one operand may inadvertently be zero due to data input errors.

Scenario 5: Multiplying by one

Details:
  Description: Test that multiplying any number by one returns the number itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use 1.0 as one input and a test number such as num1 = 7.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these inputs.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 7.0 (7.0 × 1.0).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: One is the multiplicative identity, and the result should equal the other operand. This verifies adherence to mathematical principles.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures logical consistency for identity multiplication scenarios often encountered in programming.

Scenario 6: Multiplying two fractional numbers

Details:
  Description: Validate that multiplying fractional numbers results in a precise decimal output.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set fractional inputs such as num1 = 0.5 and num2 = 0.4.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these numbers.
    Assert: Check that the result is 0.2 (0.5 × 0.4).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying fractions must yield precise decimal values to maintain accuracy in calculations like probability or scaling.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Necessary to ensure accurate results in scenarios relying on fractional computations such as simulations or optimization routines.

Scenario 7: Multiplying very large numbers

Details:
  Description: Confirm correctness when multiplying two very large numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use inputs with large values e.g., num1 = 1e+10 and num2 = 2e+10.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these values.
    Assert: Verify that the result equals 2e+20 (1e+10 × 2e+10).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Handling large values verifies correctness for extreme cases without overflow or precision loss.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensures the function can handle computations in domains like scientific calculations or financial models with high-value entries.

Scenario 8: Multiplying very small numbers

Details:
  Description: Check for precision when multiplying small numbers close to zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define very small inputs such as num1 = 1e-10 and num2 = 2e-10.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these inputs.
    Assert: Confirm that the result equals 2e-20 (1e-10 × 2e-10).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Precision testing for small numbers ensures proper handling of decimals without underflow errors.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Essential for reliability in applications involving minute scientific values or currency conversions.

Scenario 9: Multiplying two identical numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify the function calculates the square of a number correctly when the same value is multiplied by itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define identical numbers such as num1 = num2 = 3.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these values.
    Assert: Check that the result equals 9.0 (3.0 × 3.0).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying the same values effectively computes their square value. This test ensures correctness in self-multiplication cases.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Useful for verifying foundational functionality in applications relying on geometric or statistical computations.

Scenario 10: Multiplying infinity by zero

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when multiplying infinity by zero (considering edge case handling in mathematical operations).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define inputs such as num1 = math.Inf(1) and num2 = 0.0.
    Act: Call the Multiply function with these inputs.
    Assert: Check whether the result aligns with IEEE floating-point standards or produces a defined output (e.g., 0 or NaN).
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multiplying infinity by zero can lead to undefined results or specific representations consistent with IEEE standards. This test ensures the function aligns with floating-point behaviors.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Prevents inconsistencies in applications where edge cases may arise due to unconventional inputs.
