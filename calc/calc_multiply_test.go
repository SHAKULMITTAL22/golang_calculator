FUNCTION_DEF=// Multiply two floating-point numbers
func Multiply(num1, num2 float64) float64 
Scenario 1: Multiply two positive floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the Multiply function by multiplying two positive floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two positive floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the two positive numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying two positive numbers. This test is important as it validates the core functionality of the function for normal operation.

Scenario 2: Multiply two negative floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function by multiplying two negative floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two negative floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the two negative numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying two negative numbers. This test ensures that the function handles negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 3: Multiply a positive and a negative floating-point number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function by multiplying a positive and a negative floating-point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a positive and a negative floating-point number.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the positive and negative numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying a positive and a negative number. This test ensures that the function correctly handles the sign change.

Scenario 4: Multiply by zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a floating-point number and zero.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the number and zero.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying any number by zero. This test is important to ensure that the function handles the multiplication by zero edge case correctly.

Scenario 5: Multiply two very large floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when the inputs are very large floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two very large floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the two large numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying very large numbers. This test ensures that the function can handle large numbers without overflow or precision issues.

Scenario 6: Multiply two very small floating-point numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when the inputs are very small floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two very small floating-point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the two small numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying very small numbers. This test ensures that the function handles small numbers without underflow or precision issues.

Scenario 7: Multiply floating-point numbers with maximum and minimum values

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when the inputs are the maximum and minimum representable floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the maximum and minimum representable floating-point numbers using math package constants.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the maximum and minimum numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying the maximum and minimum representable floating-point numbers. This test ensures that the function handles the extreme values correctly.

Scenario 8: Multiply floating-point numbers with NaN (Not a Number)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when one of the inputs is NaN.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a floating-point number and NaN.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the number and NaN.
  Assert: Verify that the result is NaN.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying any number by NaN, which is NaN. This test ensures that the function handles NaN inputs correctly.

Scenario 9: Multiply floating-point numbers with positive and negative infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when one of the inputs is positive or negative infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a floating-point number and positive or negative infinity.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the number and infinity.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying any number by positive or negative infinity. This test ensures that the function handles infinity inputs correctly.

Scenario 10: Multiply floating-point numbers with different precisions

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when the inputs have different precisions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two floating-point numbers with different precisions.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the two numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers with appropriate precision.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying numbers with different precisions. This test ensures that the function handles precision correctly.
