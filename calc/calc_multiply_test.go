FUNCTION_DEF=func Multiply(num1, num2 float64) float64 // Multiply two floating-point numbers

Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers

Details:
Description: This is to validate that the function Multiply correctly multiplies two positive float numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: No arrangements needed as there is no dependency.
Act: Call function Multiply with inputs, for example, (2, 3)
Assert: AssertEqual on the returned float64 with 6.
Validation: Expected product is 6. The test will certify that the result of multiplying two positive numbers comes out as expected.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers

Details:
Description: This scenario tests if the function Multiply correctly multiplies two negative float numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: No arrangements needed as there is no dependency.
Act: Call function Multiply with inputs, for example, (-2, -3)
Assert: AssertEqual on the returned float64 with 6.
Validation: Since a negative multiplied by a negative is a positive, the expected product is positive 6. The test will certify that the result of multiplying two negative numbers comes out as expected.

Scenario 3: Test for Positive and Negative Numbers

Details:
Description: This will check if the function Multiply correctly multiplies a negative float and a positive float.
Execution:
Arrange: No arrangements or dependencies needed.
Act: Call function Multiply with inputs, for example, (2, -3)
Assert: AssertEqual on the returned float64 with -6.
Validation: Negative multiplied by positive is always negative, so the expected value is -6. This test will certify that multiplying a negative and a positive number results as expected.

Scenario 4: Test for Decimal Cases

Details:
Description: This scenario targets to test the multiply function on decimal numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: No arrangements or dependencies needed.
Act: Call function Multiply with inputs, for example, (0.2, 0.3)
Assert: AssertEqual on the returned float64 with 0.06.
Validation: The expected product is 0.06. This test assures that the multiplication of decimal numbers is working accurately.

Scenario 5: Test for Zero Cases

Details:
Description: This scenario checks if the function properly handles a zero value.
Execution:
Arrange: No arrangements or dependencies needed.
Act: Call function Multiply with one zero input, for example, (6, 0)
Assert: AssertEqual on the returned float64 with 0.
Validation: The multiplication with zero should always equal zero. The test will confirm that the function handles zero cases correctly.

Note: These are simple tests for a simple function. While for larger or more complex functions, more advanced testing techniques may apply. For instance, when working with shared state, parallelism issues, or functions which have side effects.
