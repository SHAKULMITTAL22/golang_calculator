FUNCTION_DEF=func Multiply(num1, num2 float64) float64
Scenario 1: Multiplication of two Positive Numbers

Details:
  This test validates the proper multiplication of two positive float64 numbers when passed to the Multiply function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two positive float64 values such as 2.5 and 3.5.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the values.
  Assert: Ensure that the result (8.75) equals the multiplication of the values.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms proper multiplication operations for positive float64 numbers. This is an essential functionality of the Multiply function, as it's the primary purpose of the function.

Scenario 2: Multiplication of Zero

Details:
  This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when it involves zero, according to the mathematical principle that multiplication with zero always equals zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive float64 value and zero, e.g., 2.5 and 0.0.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the values.
  Assert: Ensure that the result (0.0) equals the multiplication of the values.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies the function's compliance with fundamental arithmetic. It's crucial to confirm the application's correct behavior, regardless of the input values.

Scenario 3:  Multiplication with Negative Numbers

Details:
  This test verifies the Multiply function's capability to correctly handle multiplication that involves negative float64 values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a positive and a negative float64 value, such as 2.5 and -3.5.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the values.
  Assert: Confirm the returned result correctly (-8.75).
Validation:
  The assertion checks the function's versatility and adherence to arithmetic rules, confirming its ability to correctly calculate negative values. This is important because the function should be able to handle all types of float64 inputs and produce the correct output.

Scenario 4: Multiplication of Two Max Float64 Numbers

Details:
   This test is meant to verify the behavior of the Multiply function when multiplying two maximum float64 numbers. This could potentially result in an overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define two max float64 values using math.MaxFloat64.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the values.
  Assert: Assert that the result equals positive infinity, as this is what Go returns when there is a float64 overflow.
Validation:
  This assertion checks if the Multiply function can handle overflow scenarios correctly. Such tests are important as they test the boundaries and limits of the function.

Scenario 5: Multiplication of Two Min Positive Float64 Numbers

Details:
  This test checks if the Multiply function can handle multiplication with very small positive numbers, near zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two smallest positive float64 numbers using math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with both values.
  Assert: Verify that the result is also a very small positive number.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function can handle underflow scenarios correctly. It is necessary to validate the behavior of the function with extreme input values.

All these test scenarios are important because this function may be part of a large application, and the expected outputs based on different inputs help in the program's systematic and correct functioning.
