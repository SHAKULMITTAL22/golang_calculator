  Arrange: Set up the maximum and minimum representable floating-point numbers using math package constants.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the maximum and minimum numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying the maximum and minimum representable floating-point numbers. This test ensures that the function handles the extreme values correctly.

Scenario 8: Multiply floating-point numbers with NaN (Not a Number)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when one of the inputs is NaN.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a floating-point number and NaN.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the number and NaN.
  Assert: Verify that the result is NaN.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying any number by NaN, which is NaN. This test ensures that the function handles NaN inputs correctly.

Scenario 9: Multiply floating-point numbers with positive and negative infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when one of the inputs is positive or negative infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a floating-point number and positive or negative infinity.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the number and infinity.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying any number by positive or negative infinity. This test ensures that the function handles infinity inputs correctly.

Scenario 10: Multiply floating-point numbers with different precisions

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the Multiply function when the inputs have different precisions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two floating-point numbers with different precisions.
  Act: Invoke the Multiply function with the two numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the product of the two numbers with appropriate precision.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected mathematical outcome of multiplying numbers with different precisions. This test ensures that the function handles precision correctly.
