FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

Scenario 1: Regular Positive Number Input

Details:
Description: This test is meant to verify that the function correctly calculates the square root of a positive number.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a positive number such as 5.
Act: Invoke the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual result is approximately 2.236 (the square root of 5).
Validation:
The assertion is based on verifying the correctness of the math.Sqrt function from the Go math library, which is expected to accurately compute square roots. The test is important to validate the basic functionality of the provided function.

Scenario 2: Edge Case - Zero Input

Details:
Description: This test is to verify that the function handles the edge case of receiving zero as an input.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a zero integer.
Act: Invoke the SquareRoot function with zero.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly handles edge cases, as zero is a special case for the square root operation. Ensuring edge cases are handled correctly contributes to robust program behavior.

Scenario 3: Negative Number Input causing Panic

Details:
Description: This test is meant to confirm that the function correctly handles negative number inputs, which are undefined in square root operations, by panicking with the appropriate error message.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a negative number such as -5.
Act: Invoke the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
Assert: Use Go's recover function in conjunction with testing facilities to confirm that the function panics and check if the panic message is as expected.
Validation:
The assertion validates the error handling part of the function. The function is expected to panic whenever a negative argument is passed, as the square root of a negative number is undefined. This test is crucial to ensure the function behaves predictably in error scenarios.

Scenario 4: Large Positive Number

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function handles large numbers correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a large positive number such as 1e10.
Act: Invoke the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual result is approximately 1e05 (the square root of 1e10).
Validation:
The assertion validates if the function works correctly with large numbers. This test is important to ensure the function can handle a wide range of inputs.
