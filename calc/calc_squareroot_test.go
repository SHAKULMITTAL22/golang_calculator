FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

```
  Scenario 1: Testing normal operation - Positive Numbers
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the SquareRoot function on positive numbers. It should return the square root of a number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a variable with a positive numeric value.
    Act: Call the function SquareRoot with the positive number.
    Assert: Check if the return value is the square root of the number passed to the function.
  Validation:
    We are simply validating if the function "SquareRoot" is able to calculate the square root of positive numbers. This is essential as calculating square root is the function's primary purpose.

  Scenario 2: Testing edge case - Zero
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the SquareRoot function behaves when the number is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a variable with zero value.
    Act: Call the SquareRoot function with zero.
    Assert: Check if the return value from the function is also zero.
  Validation:
    The square root of zero is equal to zero, thus, this edge case scenario is intended to confirm if the function is able to handle the edge case accurately.

  Scenario 3: Testing error handling - Negative Numbers
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the SquareRoot function can handle error scenarios such as when a negative number is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a variable with a negative numeric value.
    Act: Call the function SquareRoot with the negative number.
    Assert: Check if the function panics with the correct error message.
  Validation:
    As we have defined, the square root of a negative number is not defined, therefore, we expect the function to panic with a specific error message when a negative number is passed. The idea is to test if the function is able to handle such error scenarios accurately.

  Scenario 4: Testing edge case - Very Large Numbers
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the SquareRoot function performs with very large numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a variable with a very large numeric value.
    Act: Call the function SquareRoot with a very large number.
    Assert: Check if the function can handle the large number and return a valid result without overflowing.
  Validation:
    Handling very large numbers can cause overflow issues in some cases. This test will show if the SquareRoot function can handle such cases.
