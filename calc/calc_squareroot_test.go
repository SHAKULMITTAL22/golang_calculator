FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64
```
  Scenario 1: Positive Number Input
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct computation of the square root of a positive number.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are present.
    Act: Call the SquareRoot function with a positive number such as 4.
    Assert: Compare the result to the expected square root of 2.
  Validation:
    The purpose of the assertion is to make sure that the square root calculation is correct, which ensures the core functionality of the function. The expected result is given by the math package's Sqrt function.


  Scenario 2: Zero Input
  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function handles zero input correctly. The mathematical square root of zero is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are present.
    Act: Call the SquareRoot function with 0.
    Assert: Compare the result to the expected square root of 0, which is 0.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases. The result is expected to be zero, based on mathematical rules.

  Scenario 3: Negative Number Input
  Details:
    Description: This test validates whether the function handles negative number input by throwing a panic.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are present.
    Act: Call the SquareRoot function with a negative number such as -4.
    Assert: Assert that a panic is thrown and the panic message is "square root of a negative number is not defined". Use Go's built-in testing facilities to recover from this panic and assert it occurred.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the function correctly handles exceptions and errors. The square root of a negative number isn't practically or mathematically possible, hence why a panic occurs. This is an important test case for ensuring the function's robustness in dealing with negative number inputs.
  ```

  Scenario 4: Large Number Input
  Details:
    Description: This test checks whether the function can successfully handle large number inputs without errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are present.
    Act: Call the SquareRoot function with a large number such as 1e10.
    Assert: Compare the result to the expected square root of 1e10.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the function executes correctly with large input values. This case is important, as failing to correctly calculate the square root of large numbers could lead to imprecise or incorrect results in the function relying on the SquareRoot function.
