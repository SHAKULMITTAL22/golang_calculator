FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

Scenario 1: Positive Number Input

Details:
  Description: The function should correctly compute the square root of a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive floating-point number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward as we are comparing the function's output with the expected mathematical result. This test ensures that the function works correctly for standard use cases.

Scenario 2: Zero Input

Details:
  Description: The function should return zero when the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the number zero.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with zero.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior at the boundary condition of zero, ensuring it handles this case correctly.

Scenario 3: Small Positive Number Input

Details:
  Description: The function should correctly compute the square root of a small positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a small positive floating-point number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function works accurately for very small values, which can sometimes expose precision issues.

Scenario 4: Large Positive Number Input

Details:
  Description: The function should correctly compute the square root of a large positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large positive floating-point number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input number.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle large numbers, ensuring it does not suffer from overflow or precision issues.

Scenario 5: Negative Number Input

Details:
  Description: The function should panic when the input is a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative floating-point number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "square root of a negative number is not defined".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles error conditions by panicking for negative inputs, which is a defined behavior in the function specification.

Scenario 6: Edge Case - Very Small Positive Number

Details:
  Description: The function should correctly compute the square root of a very small positive number close to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a very small positive floating-point number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input number.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior at the very edge of positive numbers, ensuring it handles extremely small values correctly.

Scenario 7: Edge Case - Very Large Positive Number

Details:
  Description: The function should correctly compute the square root of a very large positive number close to the maximum representable float64.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a very large positive floating-point number.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the largest representable float64 values without causing overflow or precision issues.

Scenario 8: Precision Test

Details:
  Description: The function should return a precise square root for a number with known square root.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a number whose square root is a known value.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the known square root.
Validation:
  This test checks the precision of the function's calculations, ensuring it returns the correct square root within acceptable tolerance.

Scenario 9: Input with Decimal Places

Details:
  Description: The function should correctly compute the square root of a number with decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a floating-point number with decimal places.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles decimal values correctly, which is a common use case for square root calculations.

Scenario 10: Input with Many Decimal Places

Details:
  Description: The function should correctly compute the square root of a number with many decimal places.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a floating-point number with many decimal places.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input number.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle numbers with high precision, ensuring it does not lose significant digits in the process.
