FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

Okay, here are the Go test scenarios for the `calc.SquareRoot` function, following the specified format.

```
Scenario 1: Test with a positive perfect square

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to correctly calculate the square root of a number that is a perfect square (e.g., 4, 9, 16).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with a value like `4.0`. Define the expected result `expected` as `2.0`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)`.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the `expected` value. Since floating-point comparisons can be tricky, use a small tolerance (epsilon) for comparison rather than direct equality.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use `math.Abs(result - expected) < tolerance` or a similar helper function. The expected result is the known mathematical square root.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. This ensures the function works for the simplest, most common positive cases.

```

```
Scenario 2: Test with a positive non-perfect square

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the square root of a positive number that is not a perfect square (e.g., 2, 3, 5.5).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with a value like `2.0`. Calculate the expected result `expected` using `math.Sqrt(2.0)`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)`.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the `expected` value using a small tolerance (epsilon).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use `math.Abs(result - expected) < tolerance`. The expected result is derived from the standard library's `math.Sqrt` function, which our function wraps.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. This validates the function's core logic for general positive inputs relies correctly on the underlying `math.Sqrt`.

```

```
Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the input number is zero (0.0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with the value `0.0`. Define the expected result `expected` as `0.0`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)`.
  Assert: Compare the returned value directly with `0.0` or using a tolerance if preferred for consistency.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The square root of 0 is mathematically 0. Direct comparison or tolerance-based comparison can be used.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Zero is an edge case between positive and negative numbers, and its correct handling is crucial.

```

```
Scenario 4: Test with one

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the input number is one (1.0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with the value `1.0`. Define the expected result `expected` as `1.0`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)`.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with `1.0` using a small tolerance (epsilon).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The square root of 1 is 1. Use `math.Abs(result - expected) < tolerance`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. One is a simple case but good to include for basic validation.

```

```
Scenario 5: Test with a negative number (panic expected)

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function panics as expected when provided with a negative input, according to its documented behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with a negative value like `-4.0`. Define the expected panic message `expectedPanicMsg` as `"square root of a negative number is not defined"`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)` within a deferred function that uses `recover()` to catch the expected panic.
  Assert: Check if a panic occurred. If it did, compare the recovered panic value (converted to a string or error) with the `expectedPanicMsg`. The test fails if no panic occurs or if the panic message is different.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The assertion involves checking for a panic and validating its message using `recover()`. The function explicitly defines this panic behavior for negative inputs.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. This validates the function's error handling mechanism for invalid inputs, preventing undefined behavior or incorrect results.

```

```
Scenario 6: Test with a large positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with a very large positive floating-point number, close to the maximum representable value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with the value `math.MaxFloat64`. Calculate the expected result `expected` using `math.Sqrt(math.MaxFloat64)`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)`.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the `expected` value using a small tolerance (epsilon). Note that the result might also be very large.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use `math.Abs(result - expected) < tolerance`. This tests the function's robustness and reliance on `math.Sqrt` for handling large values without overflow or precision issues beyond what `math.Sqrt` itself handles.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Ensures the function doesn't fail unexpectedly for inputs within the valid range, even at the extremes.

```

```
Scenario 7: Test with a small positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with a very small positive floating-point number, close to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with a small positive value like `1e-10` or `math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64`. Calculate the expected result `expected` using `math.Sqrt(num)`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)`.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the `expected` value using a small tolerance (epsilon).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Use `math.Abs(result - expected) < tolerance`. This tests precision and handling of numbers near the lower boundary of positive values.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Ensures correct behavior for small magnitude inputs, which can be important in scientific or financial calculations.

```

```
Scenario 8: Test with negative zero (-0.0)

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior with negative zero (-0.0), which is distinct from 0.0 in floating-point representation but should behave like 0.0 for comparison purposes in this function's logic (`-0.0 < 0` is false).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a float64 variable `num` with the value `-0.0`. Define the expected result `expected` as `0.0`.
  Act: Call `calc.SquareRoot(num)`.
  Assert: Compare the returned value directly with `0.0` or using a tolerance. Ensure no panic occurs.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The condition `num < 0` evaluates to false for `-0.0`, so the function should proceed to calculate `math.Sqrt(-0.0)`, which returns `0.0`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. This is a subtle edge case related to floating-point representation and comparison, ensuring the boundary condition check (`< 0`) works as intended even with signed zero.
