FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

Scenario 1: Positive real number square root

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to test the positive real number square root operation when a positive real number is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is necessary in this scenario.
  Act: Invoke the SquareRoot function with a positive real number as the parameter.
  Assert: Use the Go equal assertion to verify that the outcome is correct by comparing the return value with the accurate square root of the given number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the integral numeric logic of the square root calculation. The returned value should exactly match the correct square root. This test is crucial because it verifies the fundamental functionality of the SquareRoot function.


Scenario 2: Square root of zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function behaves correctly when the input value is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is necessary.
  Act: Pass zero to the SquareRoot function.
  Assert: Go's equal assertion should be used to ensure that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  According to mathematical rules, the square root of zero is zero. So the function should act accordingly. This test is significant because passing zero as an argument to functions is a common edge case in testing.


Scenario 3: Negative number error handling

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the SquareRoot function correctly panics when trying to calculate the square root of a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is being made.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with a negative number.
  Assert: Use Go's recover() function together with a deferred function call to catch the panic and confirm that the panicâ€™s error message matches the expected panic message.
Validation:
  This test is expected to trigger a defined panic, as the computation of a square root for a negative number is mathematically undefined. This test ensures that the function properly handles this situation, which validates that our error handling functionality is working as intended.
