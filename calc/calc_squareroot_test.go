FUNCTION_DEF=func SquareRoot(num float64) float64 // Square root (with error handling)

Scenario 1: Test SquareRoot with a Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly calculates the square root of a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive number as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the positive number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the expected square root of the input.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward, comparing the returned value to the expected square root. This test ensures that the function works correctly for standard input and provides confidence in the mathematical correctness of the implementation.

Scenario 2: Test SquareRoot with Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles the input of zero, which should return zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define zero as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with zero.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function handles the boundary case of zero correctly. This is important as zero is a special case in mathematics where the square root is defined.

Scenario 3: Test SquareRoot with a Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly calculates the square root of a large number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a large number as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the large number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the expected square root of the input.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function can handle large numbers without precision issues. This is crucial for applications needing to compute square roots of large datasets.

Scenario 4: Test SquareRoot with a Small Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly calculates the square root of a small number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a small number as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the small number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the expected square root of the input.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function can handle small numbers with appropriate precision. This is important for applications requiring precise calculations.

Scenario 5: Test SquareRoot with a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles negative input by panicking with the appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative number as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the negative number.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "square root of a negative number is not defined".
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies and handles invalid input (negative numbers) by panicking. This is essential for avoiding incorrect results and maintaining the integrity of the application.

Scenario 6: Test SquareRoot with NaN (Not-a-Number)

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles NaN input, which should ideally return NaN.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define NaN as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with NaN.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is NaN.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function behaves correctly when given NaN input, maintaining mathematical integrity and avoiding unexpected behavior.

Scenario 7: Test SquareRoot with Infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles positive infinity input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define positive infinity as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with positive infinity.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is positive infinity.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly handles infinity, which is a boundary case in mathematical computations.

Scenario 8: Test SquareRoot with Negative Infinity

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles negative infinity input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define negative infinity as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with negative infinity.
  Assert: Verify that the function panics with the message "square root of a negative number is not defined".
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies and handles negative infinity input by panicking, maintaining the integrity of the application.

Scenario 9: Test SquareRoot with Precision

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function maintains precision for a number with a fractional part.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a number with a fractional part as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the fractional number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the expected square root of the input with the required precision.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function provides accurate results for numbers with fractional parts, which is important for applications requiring precise calculations.

Scenario 10: Test SquareRoot with an Edge Case of Epsilon

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the SquareRoot function correctly handles a very small positive number (epsilon).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a very small positive number (epsilon) as the input.
  Act: Call the SquareRoot function with the epsilon number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the expected square root of the input.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function can handle very small positive numbers, which is essential for applications needing to compute square roots of very small datasets.
